            <h2>The Author's Ghost: From Romantic Ego to Posthuman Practice</h2>

            <h3>Introduction: The Enduring Contradiction of the Creative Self</h3>
            <p>A profound and persistent contradiction lies at the heart of contemporary attitudes toward art and authorship. On one hand, there is widespread admiration for the radical experiments of the 20th-century avant-garde—the Dadaists, Surrealists, and experimental composers who deliberately sought to dismantle the authorial ego, remove conscious intention from the creative act, and introduce chance, absurdity, and the subconscious as generative forces.<a href="#ref1">[1]</a>, <a href="#ref2">[2]</a>, <a href="#ref3">[3]</a>, <a href="#ref4">[4]</a> On the other hand, the dawn of sophisticated artificial intelligence (AI) has ignited a passionate, almost moralistic defense of the individual human artist as the sole font of authentic creativity. Arguments that AI-generated art "lacks soul," emotion, or a unique personal vision are now commonplace, framing the human mind as a sacred, irreplaceable wellspring of meaning that must be protected and rewarded.<a href="#ref5">[5]</a>, <a href="#ref6">[6]</a>, <a href="#ref7">[7]</a> This creates a paradox: a simultaneous celebration of artistic movements that sought to kill the author and a fervent desire to resurrect the author's ghost to fend off the machine.</p>
            <p>This report will explore the historical and philosophical roots of this contradiction by tracing the evolution of two competing models of creativity. The first is the <strong>Romantic Ego</strong>, a historically specific ideal of the artist as a solitary genius whose work is a direct expression of a unique inner world.<a href="#ref8">[8]</a>, <a href="#ref9">[9]</a>, <a href="#ref10">[10]</a> This model, born in the late 18th century, became the bedrock of modern copyright law, designed to reward the individual creator for their original intellectual and emotional labor. The second is the <strong>Anti-Ego</strong> of the 20th-century avant-garde, which actively subverted the Romantic ideal through techniques of <strong>aleatoricism</strong> (chance operations) and <strong>automatism</strong> (unconscious expression) to decenter the artist's conscious will.<a href="#ref1">[1]</a>, <a href="#ref2">[2]</a>, <a href="#ref3">[3]</a>, <a href="#ref4">[4]</a> This practical assault on authorial control found its theoretical culmination in postmodernism's declaration of the "Death of the Author," which relocated the site of meaning from the creator's intention to the reader's interpretation.<a href="#ref11">[11]</a>, <a href="#ref12">[12]</a></p>
            <p>Today, the debate over AI-generated art and copyright has become the primary battleground where these historical tensions are reanimated and contested.<a href="#ref13">[13]</a>, <a href="#ref14">[14]</a>, <a href="#ref15">[15]</a> This report posits that the apparent contradiction in popular thought is not a simple hypocrisy but reveals a deep, unresolved conflict in the Western theory of authorship. This conflict, however, can be resolved. Drawing upon the philosophical framework presented in the manuscript <em>Mind, Machine, and Will</em>, this report will argue that the contradiction dissolves when we abandon the flawed, mentalist model of creativity—the "Cartesian ghost" of the inner self—and adopt a framework grounded in public, observable, and socially negotiated <strong>practice</strong>.<a href="#ref16">[16]</a> By tracing the historical arc of this conflict, from the birth of the Romantic author to the avant-garde's rebellion and the contemporary challenges of AI, this analysis will demonstrate that a practice-based understanding of agency allows us to appreciate both historical experiments and new technological forms of creation without contradiction, while reframing the debate over artists' rights in a more coherent and sustainable way.</p>

            <h3>Part I: The Genesis of the Authorial Ego: Romanticism and the Myth of the Solitary Genius</h3>
            <h4>The Philosophical Turn to the Subject</h4>
            <p>The figure of the artist as a solitary genius, whose work flows from a unique and ineffable inner world, is not a timeless truth but a specific historical invention. Its origins lie in Romanticism, the artistic and intellectual movement that swept across Europe at the end of the 18th century as a direct reaction to the Enlightenment's emphasis on universal reason, order, and scientific rationalism.<a href="#ref8">[8]</a>, <a href="#ref17">[17]</a> Where the Enlightenment valued objectivity and calm balance, Romanticism championed subjectivity, emotion, individualism, and intuition as the primary modes of understanding the world.<a href="#ref8">[8]</a>, <a href="#ref17">[17]</a> This philosophical shift was also a response to the social and economic upheavals of the Industrial Revolution, which many felt had alienated humanity from nature and from more authentic ways of being.<a href="#ref18">[18]</a></p>
            <p>In this new climate, the artist's role was radically redefined. No longer a skilled artisan working within established conventions, the artist became a visionary, a hero, a figure whose unique perceptions and intense feelings gave them special access to profound truths.<a href="#ref10">[10]</a>, <a href="#ref19">[19]</a> The source of art was relocated from the external world of shared forms to the internal world of the individual's mind and soul. William Wordsworth's famous definition of poetry as "the spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings" became the manifesto for this new creative ideal, emphasizing sincerity, personal experience, and emotional authenticity over formal adherence to classical rules.<a href="#ref19">[19]</a> The "Romantic self" was conceived as a "profounder, more authentic ego lying beneath the layers of social convention," and it was the artist's task to give voice to this deep, original selfhood.<a href="#ref9">[9]</a>, <a href="#ref20">[20]</a></p>

            <h4>The Artist as Visionary Genius</h4>
            <p>This new ideal elevated the artist to the status of a "supremely individual creator," whose creative spirit was deemed more important than technical mastery or traditional procedures.<a href="#ref10">[10]</a> Imagination was exalted as the highest human faculty, a "gateway to transcendent experience and spiritual truth" that could unify the fragmented modern world.<a href="#ref10">[10]</a> The poet William Blake declared, “One Power alone makes a Poet: Imagination, the Divine Vision,” capturing the belief that the artist's mind was a conduit for something visionary and almost mystical.<a href="#ref10">[10]</a></p>
            <p>This focus on the inner world meant that the primary subject matter of art became the artist's own personality, moods, and mental potentialities.<a href="#ref19">[19]</a> The Romantics found the source of poetry not in the general or the typical, but in the "particular, unique experience" of the individual.<a href="#ref10">[10]</a> This valorization of the individual's internal vision created a powerful cultural myth: that of the solitary genius, whose originality stems from a source untouched by convention and inaccessible to ordinary people. This myth positioned the artist as fundamentally different from society, a figure whose authority derived not from tradition but from the authenticity of their personal feelings and imagination.</p>

            <h4>Codifying Genius in Law</h4>
            <p>This philosophical elevation of the Romantic ego did not remain a purely abstract or artistic ideal; it soon became the implicit foundation for modern copyright law. As the Industrial Revolution fueled the growth of printing and publishing, creating new markets for literary and artistic works, a legal framework was needed to protect the economic interests of this new type of creator. The resulting copyright systems were designed specifically to reward and incentivize the Romantic model of creation by granting exclusive rights to the "author" of an "original work of authorship".<a href="#ref21">[21]</a>, <a href="#ref22">[22]</a>, <a href="#ref23">[23]</a>, <a href="#ref24">[24]</a></p>
            <p>The legal concept of "originality" became inextricably linked to the Romantic ideal of the individual mind as the source of creation. U.S. copyright law, for instance, requires that a work be "independently created by a human author" and possess a "minimal degree of creativity"—a "spark" that originates from the author's own intellectual and expressive choices.<a href="#ref22">[22]</a> This legal requirement for a human mind as the point of origin is a direct legacy of the Romantic belief in the solitary genius. As the manuscript <em>Mind, Machine, and Will</em> argues, this "human authorship requirement" is a "philosophical error" because it grounds the value of a work in the inaccessible "internal mental states of a single human agent," a model that is both conceptually flawed and increasingly unworkable in the modern world.<a href="#ref16">[16]</a></p>
            <p>The historical development reveals a clear causal chain: the philosophical movement of Romanticism created a new cultural ideal of the artist as a unique, individual genius. This ideal, in turn, shaped the development of a legal framework—copyright—that codified and monetized this specific form of creativity. For centuries, this legal structure reinforced the cultural dominance of the Romantic author model, making it seem like a natural and universal truth about how art is made. It is this inherited, legally-entrenched model of the "Romantic ego" that now fuels the defense of human artists against the perceived threat of AI.</p>

            <h3>Part II: The 20th-Century Assault on the Ego: Avant-Garde Strategies of Impersonality</h3>
            <p>The cultural dominance of the Romantic ego did not go unchallenged. The early 20th century, scarred by the unprecedented carnage of World War I, gave rise to a series of avant-garde movements that launched a direct and often violent assault on the bourgeois values of reason, logic, and individual expression that they believed had led to the catastrophe.<a href="#ref25">[25]</a>, <a href="#ref26">[26]</a>, <a href="#ref27">[27]</a>, <a href="#ref28">[28]</a> These movements—most notably Dadaism, Surrealism, and the experimental music of composers like John Cage—sought to dismantle the authorial ego by systematically removing the artist's conscious intention from the creative process.</p>

            <h4>"Dada Means Nothing": Chance, Absurdity, and the Rejection of Authorial Control</h4>
            <p>Dadaism emerged in Zurich in 1916 as a movement of "anarchic revolt" against a society whose rationality seemed to have produced only madness and destruction.<a href="#ref25">[25]</a> Dada was not art; it was "anti-art".<a href="#ref28">[28]</a> It rejected traditional aesthetics, prizing nonsense, irrationality, and intuition.<a href="#ref28">[28]</a> To achieve this, Dadaists employed techniques explicitly designed to subvert authorial control and introduce chance as a creative agent.</p>
            <p>The most famous of these is the <strong>cut-up technique</strong>, pioneered by the poet Tristan Tzara. His instructions for "To Make a Dadaist Poem" were simple and revolutionary: take a newspaper article, cut out the words, put them in a bag, shake it, and then copy down the words in the random order they are pulled out.<a href="#ref29">[29]</a>, <a href="#ref30">[30]</a>, <a href="#ref31">[31]</a> In this process, the author is no longer a genius expressing a profound inner vision; they are merely an administrator of a chance operation. The goal was to "destroy old aesthetic habits" and create a poetry that "will resemble you," not because it expresses your inner self, but because the universe, through chance, has generated a text in your presence.<a href="#ref30">[30]</a>, <a href="#ref32">[32]</a> This method directly mocked the Romantic idea of artistic talent and intentionality, making randomness the true author.<a href="#ref31">[31]</a></p>

            <h4>"Psychic Automatism": The Surrealist Subconscious as Author</h4>
            <p>Emerging from the anarchic spirit of Dada, Surrealism offered a more systematic approach to bypassing the conscious ego, heavily influenced by the psychoanalytic theories of Sigmund Freud.<a href="#ref2">[2]</a>, <a href="#ref33">[33]</a>, <a href="#ref34">[34]</a> The Surrealists believed that the unconscious mind was a wellspring of powerful and authentic creativity, uncorrupted by reason and social convention. Their goal was to tap into this source directly.</p>
            <p>To do this, they developed the technique of <strong>automatism</strong>, defined by André Breton in the <em>Manifesto of Surrealism</em> as "Psychic automatism in its pure state, by which one proposes to express...the actual functioning of thought...in the absence of any control exercised by reason".<a href="#ref2">[2]</a>, <a href="#ref33">[33]</a> In practice, this took the form of <strong>automatic writing and drawing</strong>, where the artist would allow their hand to move across the page as quickly as possible, without any preconceived plan or conscious intervention.<a href="#ref2">[2]</a>, <a href="#ref4">[4]</a>, <a href="#ref35">[35]</a>, <a href="#ref36">[36]</a>, <a href="#ref37">[37]</a> The resulting works were seen as a direct transcription of the subconscious. While Dadaism used external chance to displace the author, Surrealism substituted one part of the psyche—the irrational subconscious—for another—the rational, conscious ego.<a href="#ref38">[38]</a> The artist was no longer a visionary genius but a medium, channeling the hidden forces of their own mind.</p>

            <h4>"A Purposeful Purposelessness": John Cage and Aleatoric Methods</h4>
            <p>The American composer John Cage took the avant-garde's anti-ego project to its philosophical conclusion. Deeply influenced by Zen Buddhism, Cage sought to create music that was free from his own "likes and dislikes," his personal tastes and psychological habits.<a href="#ref3">[3]</a>, <a href="#ref39">[39]</a>, <a href="#ref40">[40]</a> His goal was to let sounds "be themselves" rather than vehicles for a composer's emotions or ideas.</p>
            <p>To achieve this, he employed <strong>aleatoric</strong> or <strong>chance operations</strong> in his compositions.<a href="#ref3">[3]</a>, <a href="#ref41">[41]</a> For his seminal 1951 piano piece, <em>Music of Changes</em>, Cage used the <em>I Ching</em>, the ancient Chinese book of divination, to make decisions about every aspect of the composition: pitch, duration, tempo, and dynamics.<a href="#ref42">[42]</a>, <a href="#ref43">[43]</a> By tossing coins to consult the <em>I Ching</em>'s hexagrams, Cage created a complex musical score that was the product of a system external to his own will.<a href="#ref39">[39]</a> He described this process as a way to become "attentive to what is outside of my own psychology and memory".<a href="#ref39">[39]</a> This represented a crucial step beyond both Dada and Surrealism. The source of the artwork was no longer external chance (like words in a hat) or an internal subconscious, but a structured, external system that the composer chose to obey.</p>

            <h4>The Theoretical Culmination: Roland Barthes and "The Death of the Author"</h4>
            <p>In 1967, the French literary theorist Roland Barthes provided the philosophical capstone to these decades of artistic experimentation with his essay "The Death of the Author".<a href="#ref11">[11]</a>, <a href="#ref12">[12]</a>, <a href="#ref44">[44]</a> Barthes argued that the very idea of deciphering a text by appealing to the author's intentions or biography was a flawed and tyrannical practice.<a href="#ref12">[12]</a> For Barthes, a text is not a message from a single "Author-God" but a "multi-dimensional space" woven from "innumerable centers of culture".<a href="#ref12">[12]</a>, <a href="#ref45">[45]</a></p>
            <p>He famously declared that a text's unity lies "not in its origin, but in its destination"—that is, in the reader.<a href="#ref12">[12]</a>, <a href="#ref46">[46]</a> The author is merely a "scriptor" who is "born simultaneously with the text" but does not precede or control it.<a href="#ref45">[45]</a> By "killing" the author, Barthes sought to liberate the text, allowing for a multiplicity of interpretations and empowering the reader as the primary site of meaning-making.<a href="#ref12">[12]</a>, <a href="#ref47">[47]</a> This essay provided the theoretical language for what artists like Tzara and Cage had already been demonstrating in practice: that the Romantic ego was not an essential condition for the creation of art.</p>

            <h3>Part III: The Ghost in the Machine: The Romantic Ego Reanimated in the Age of AI</h3>
            <p>Despite the 20th century's sustained artistic and philosophical assault on the authorial ego, the rise of generative AI has provoked a powerful resurgence of Romantic ideals. The contemporary debate surrounding AI-generated art is saturated with arguments that implicitly or explicitly champion the human mind as the only source of true creativity. This reanimation of the Romantic ego is not merely a philosophical preference; it is a deeply felt response to perceived threats to human dignity, labor, and economic security.</p>

            <h4>"AI Lacks Soul": Contemporary Defenses of Human Artistry</h4>
            <p>The most common arguments against the legitimacy of AI-generated art are fundamentally neo-Romantic in character. Critics contend that AI art lacks "soul," emotion, and the unique "artist's hand" that comes from personal experience.<a href="#ref6">[6]</a>, <a href="#ref13">[13]</a>, <a href="#ref48">[48]</a> Experts in various fields argue that AI, as a "superb mimic," can replicate styles but cannot produce "true insight and experience" or the "inimitable details that could come only from personal experience".<a href="#ref6">[6]</a> This perspective frames creativity as an essentially human endeavor rooted in consciousness, emotion, and lived embodiment—qualities that a machine, by definition, cannot possess. The argument that AI compositions "lack surprise, emotion, and even silence" echoes the Romantic premium on spontaneous feeling and subjective depth.<a href="#ref6">[6]</a></p>
            <p>These defenses effectively resurrect the Romantic hierarchy that places the artist's internal world at the apex of creative value. The critique that AI is merely a tool that "regurgitates" data without "genuine vision" maps directly onto the Romantic distinction between mechanical craft and authentic, original genius.<a href="#ref6">[6]</a> In this view, the human artist is defined by their capacity for spiritual and emotional expression, a capacity that makes their work uniquely meaningful and valuable.</p>

            <h4>Copyright as the Last Bastion of the Human Mind</h4>
            <p>This neo-Romantic defense of human creativity has found its most powerful expression on the legal front. The "human authorship requirement" embedded in copyright law has become the primary legal bulwark against the perceived encroachment of AI.<a href="#ref14">[14]</a>, <a href="#ref21">[21]</a> High-profile lawsuits filed by artists against AI companies are framed as a moral and legal battle to protect human creativity from being devalued, mimicked, and exploited by "soulless" machines that have been trained on their work without consent or compensation.<a href="#ref7">[7]</a></p>
            <p>This legal strategy implicitly reinforces the Romantic model of authorship. By insisting that only a human can be an "author" in the eyes of the law, these arguments re-inscribe the human mind as the sole legitimate origin point of copyrightable value. The legal battle is thus not just about economic rights; it is about defending the special status of human consciousness as the necessary condition for the creation of "original works of authorship."</p>

            <h4>The Artist's Labor and the Ethics of Reward</h4>
            <p>At its core, the debate is also profoundly economic. The impassioned argument for rewarding individual artists whose work is used to train AI models is based on the principle that their unique skill, creative labor, and personal expression are being appropriated and monetized without their consent.<a href="#ref7">[7]</a>, <a href="#ref48">[48]</a> This position reinforces the foundational logic of the Romantic-era copyright system: the individual creator, through their unique effort and vision, produces something of value and therefore has a right to control and profit from it.</p>
            <p>This brings the central contradiction into sharp relief. The avant-garde's use of external, non-human processes (like chance or the subconscious) was celebrated as a radical artistic choice that expanded the possibilities of creativity. Today, the use of another external, non-human process (AI) is widely feared as an existential threat that diminishes and devalues human creativity. The key to understanding this thematic inversion lies not in the processes themselves, but in the perceived locus of control and economic agency.</p>
            <p>The Dadaist, Surrealist, or experimental composer <em>chose</em> to cede control to an external system as a sovereign artistic act. John Cage was the author of the <em>system</em> that produced the music; his decision to remove his ego was itself an expression of his authorial will. In contrast, the contemporary artist often feels that control over their work and their economic viability is being <em>wrested away</em> by large, opaque corporate systems that deploy AI. The fight is not against the non-human process of generation itself, but against the economic and power structures that control it. Therefore, the popular defense of the "Romantic ego" today is not merely a return to an old aesthetic philosophy. It functions as a powerful proxy for defending the economic and moral rights of the individual human creator in the face of a technological and economic system that seems to threaten their autonomy and livelihood.</p>

            <h3>Part IV: A Practice-Based Resolution: Beyond the Inner State in Art and Law</h3>
            <p>The persistent contradiction between celebrating the anti-ego of the avant-garde and defending the Romantic ego against AI can be resolved by moving beyond the flawed philosophical foundation that underpins both positions: the belief that authorship is fundamentally a matter of an artist's internal mental state. The manuscript <em>Mind, Machine, and Will</em> provides a powerful alternative by advocating for a practice-based understanding of agency, meaning, and creativity.<a href="#ref16">[16]</a> This framework, rooted in the philosophy of Ludwig Wittgenstein, argues that these concepts are not private, internal phenomena but are constituted in public, socially negotiated practices.<a href="#ref16">[16]</a></p>

            <h4>The Philosophical Error: Deconstructing the "Cartesian Ghost" in Authorship</h4>
            <p>The traditional model of authorship, whether it locates creativity in the conscious intention of the Romantic genius or the unconscious depths of the Surrealist, is based on what the manuscript calls a "philosophical error": the reliance on "inner states" or the "Cartesian ghost" as the source of meaning.<a href="#ref16">[16]</a> Wittgenstein's critique of private language demonstrates that meaning cannot be established by a solitary mind; it requires public criteria and shared rules within a "form of life".<a href="#ref16">[16]</a> Applying this to art, authorship is not an expression of a hidden inner world but an action performed within a set of social conventions and recognized by a community.</p>

            <h4>From Intention to Participation: Reframing Avant-Garde and AI Art</h4>
            <p>A practice-based model allows us to re-evaluate both avant-garde experiments and AI-assisted art without contradiction. The avant-garde artists were not metaphysically "removing the ego"; they were inventing and participating in <em>new social practices of art-making</em>. Tristan Tzara's cut-up technique is not a magical act but a set of public, repeatable instructions for a new kind of language game.<a href="#ref31">[31]</a> John Cage's use of the <em>I Ching</em> is not an abdication of authorship but the creation and execution of a new compositional <em>system</em>—a new practice with its own rules and procedures.<a href="#ref39">[39]</a> The value and meaning of their work derive from their skillful participation in these new practices, which challenged the existing conventions of art.</p>
            <p>Similarly, creating art with AI is not a "soulless," non-human act. It is a new creative <em>practice</em> that involves a distinct set of skills: prompt engineering, curating outputs, editing, and post-production.<a href="#ref5">[5]</a> The human is not a passive bystander but an active participant—an "orchestrator, a curator" who guides a technological process within a creative workflow.<a href="#ref16">[16]</a> From a practice-based perspective, the question is not whether the machine has a mind, but whether the human-machine collaboration constitutes a skillful and meaningful performance within a recognized (or emerging) artistic practice.</p>

            <h4>The <em>Bartz</em> Standard and the Legal Shift to Practice</h4>
            <p>This philosophical shift from inner states to public practice is not merely a theoretical proposal; it is already happening in the real world, most notably in the evolution of copyright law. The manuscript <em>Mind, Machine, and Will</em> identifies the legal system as a "copyright laboratory" where these ideas are being tested under the pressure of new technologies.<a href="#ref16">[16]</a></p>
            <p>The traditional "human authorship requirement," with its mentalist focus on "original intellectual conception," is proving inadequate.<a href="#ref16">[16]</a> In response, courts are beginning to shift toward practice-based standards. The landmark case of <em>Bartz v. Anthropic</em> is presented as a pivotal moment in this transition.<a href="#ref16">[16]</a> By focusing on whether the use of copyrighted material for AI training was "exceedingly transformative" and created new value—analogous to how a human learns and synthesizes information—the court moved the legal inquiry away from the author's internal state and toward the observable <em>practice</em> and its <em>outcome</em>.<a href="#ref16">[16]</a> The emerging legal standard, what the manuscript calls the "<em>Bartz</em> standard," prioritizes "value creation" and "transformative contribution" over subjective creative intention. The law is beginning to ask not "What did the author feel?" but "What was done, how was it done, and what new value did this practice bring into the world?"</p>

            <h3>Conclusion: Living After the Romantic Ego—A New Framework for Creativity</h3>
            <p>The contradiction that animates the contemporary debate over authorship is resolved by abandoning the flawed and outdated model of the "inner state." A practice-based framework allows us to see both the 20th-century avant-garde and 21st-century AI artists not as opposites, but as participants in a long history of expanding and redefining the very practices of art-making. Both represent valid forms of human agency enacted through different sets of tools, systems, and social conventions.</p>
            <p>This resolution also clarifies the stakes in the ongoing fight to reward and protect artists in the age of AI. The goal should not be to legally protect a metaphysical "soul" or a Romantic ideal of genius that was, from its inception, a historical construct. Instead, the focus must be on designing fair, transparent, and equitable economic and legal <em>practices</em> that recognize and compensate the demonstrable skill, labor, and transformative contributions of human artists as they participate in these new and evolving creative ecosystems. The struggle is not to save the ghost of the Romantic ego, but to ensure that living, working artists have agency, dignity, and economic security within the new, technologically-mediated practices of creation that will define the future of culture.</p>
