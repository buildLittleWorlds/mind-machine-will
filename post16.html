            <h2>Advisory Opinions: Episode 6 - A Response to Cory Doctorow</h2>
            <p class="meta">By David French and Sarah Isgur | August 1, 2025</p>
            
            <p><em>This special mailbag episode is a direct response to a powerful critique of the manuscript written from the perspective of author and activist Cory Doctorow. You can read his full imagined post here: <a href="post4.html"><strong>Cory Doctorow:</strong> Science Fiction is EXPOSING Scams and AI Dystopia</a>.</em></p>

            <p>(Intro Music with an academic, slightly classical feel fades in and then fades out)</p>

            <p><strong>Sarah Isgur:</strong> Welcome back to Advisory Opinions. I’m Sarah Isgur, joined by David French. And David, I thought we were done. I thought our five-part journey through the very dense, very philosophical manuscript *Mind, Machine, and Will* was complete.</p>

            <p><strong>David French:</strong> I thought so too. We explored its radical claims about copyright, criminal justice, and the Constitution itself. It was a fascinating, if at times deeply unsettling, intellectual exercise.</p>

            <p><strong>Sarah Isgur:</strong> It was. But then we got a piece of feedback—a critique of the manuscript from a very different perspective—that was so compelling we felt we had to come back for one more episode. A sort of mailbag episode to address this reality check. It comes from the writer and activist Cory Doctorow, and he starts by agreeing with the book’s premise before taking a very sharp turn.</p>

            <p><strong>David French:</strong> He does. He basically says the book’s diagnosis is correct, but its understanding of the world is hopelessly naive. He writes:</p>

            <p><em>(Reading from script)</em> “This book describes a beautiful, clean, philosophical revolution, a kind of intellectual changing of the guard where better ideas gracefully displace worse ones. It's a story about paradigms shifting. What’s missing is the street fight. What's missing is the money. What's missing is the raw, brutal application of power that actually decides which 'practices' become the norm and who gets screwed in the process.”</p>

            <p><strong>Sarah Isgur:</strong> And that, David, is the sound of my pragmatic, institutionalist heart singing the Hallelujah Chorus. This is the critique I was trying to articulate throughout our series. The manuscript describes this elegant, almost bloodless evolution of legal doctrine. Doctorow comes in and says, "Are you kidding me? This isn't a philosophy seminar; it's a back-alley knife fight over money and power." He argues the book has a brilliant theory of mind, but no theory of *power*. And that, to me, is the whole ballgame.</p>

            <p><strong>David French:</strong> I think that’s a fair and incredibly important critique. The book operates at 30,000 feet, tracing the logical consequences of a philosophical shift. Doctorow is firmly on the ground, pointing out that legal and social change is rarely so clean. It’s almost always driven by brute force—economic, political, and corporate. But while I think his critique is vital, I’m not sure I agree that it completely invalidates the manuscript’s project. In fact, I think they need each other.</p>

            <p><strong>Sarah Isgur:</strong> Okay, I’m intrigued. Let’s get into it. Doctorow’s first big point of contention is on copyright law. Where the book sees an "accidental wisdom" in the law's evolution, he sees something much more deliberate and sinister.</p>

            <p>(Transition Music)</p>

            <p><strong>Sarah Isgur:</strong> So, we spent all of Episode 2 talking about copyright as a "doctrinal laboratory." We discussed the *Bartz v. Anthropic* hypothetical, where the court’s focus on the "provenance of training data" was framed as this sophisticated pivot to a "practice-based" model. Doctorow read that and, I think it’s fair to say, laughed out loud. He writes:</p>
            
            <p><em>(Reading from script)</em> “Here's another [way to put it]: it’s a high-stakes brawl over whether a handful of titanic firms get to launder the entire creative output of humanity through a statistical blender and sell it back to us forever, without paying the people who did the work. They call it 'learning'; creators call it industrial-scale plagiarism. To frame this as a gentle turn toward a more enlightened, Wittgensteinian legal standard is to mistake the sound of a knife fight for a philosophical debate.”</p>

            <p><strong>Sarah Isgur:</strong> I mean, that is just devastatingly effective. He’s saying the book is providing a high-minded philosophical cover for what is essentially mass corporate theft. He points to Mark Zuckerberg, who used adversarial interoperability to build Facebook and then spent a decade weaponizing the law to make sure no one could do the same to him. That’s not a "paradigm shift," that's monopoly power plain and simple. This really resonates with me, because the law doesn't operate in a vacuum. It operates in a world of lobbyists, campaign contributions, and regulatory capture. A theory that ignores that is missing the main driver of legal change.</p>

            <p><strong>David French:</strong> I don't disagree with his description of the fight. It *is* a brutal, high-stakes battle. But I think he’s too quick to dismiss the importance of the principles at stake. The reason creators have any ground to stand on at all is because of the underlying legal and philosophical principles of authorship and property. The reason we can even have a debate about "industrial-scale plagiarism" is because we have a shared understanding that plagiarism is wrong. Doctorow’s argument is entirely about power, but the only legitimate way to check power is with principle. Without the framework of law and ethics, it’s just might-makes-right.</p>

            <p><strong>Sarah Isgur:</strong> But his point is that the "principles" are being shaped by the power! The reason "transformative use" is even on the table as a defense for AI training is because a handful of multi-trillion-dollar companies have the resources to hire every top lawyer in the country to argue that it is. The principle doesn’t exist in a Platonic realm; it’s being forged in the crucible of a power struggle, and the side with more money is usually the one holding the hammer.</p>

            <p><strong>David French:</strong> But that’s precisely why the manuscript’s project is so important. By clarifying the underlying philosophy, it gives us better intellectual tools to fight that battle. If we can successfully argue, as the book helps us to, that authorship is an observable practice of creation, it makes it harder for tech companies to hide behind the black box of their algorithms. The book is providing the intellectual ammunition for the street fight. Doctorow is right that it's a fight, but you can't win a fight with slogans alone. You need a coherent legal argument. That's what the book is trying to build.</p>

            <p><strong>Sarah Isgur:</strong> I think that gives the book too much credit for its real-world impact. But this clash between the book’s clean theory and Doctorow’s messy reality is even clearer when they talk about the nature of AI itself.</p>

            <p>(Transition Music)</p>

            <p><strong>David French:</strong> The manuscript, as we discussed, uses the Wittgensteinian metaphor of AI as a "Language Game Participant." It’s a way of analyzing AI's function within a social system without getting bogged down in questions of consciousness. Doctorow finds this metaphor not just wrong, but dangerous.</p>

            <p><strong>Sarah Isgur:</strong> Dangerously naive. His description of AI is... well, it’s classic Doctorow. He writes:</p>

            <p><em>(Reading from script)</em> “An LLM isn't 'participating' in a conversation any more than a pickup artist who spams a million women with the same negging line is 'participating' in a romance... it's a numbers game, a con. And that's what AI is: a very sophisticated, very expensive con for convincing people that a stochastic parrot has a soul, right before it takes their job and sells them a subscription to the chatbot that replaced them.”</p>
            
            <p><strong>Sarah Isgur:</strong> I mean, wow. The "stochastic parrot" line is well-known, but the "Texas marksman" analogy—firing a million shots and then drawing a target around the one that hit something—is just perfect. It completely demystifies AI. And this is where I think he’s 100% correct. The book’s metaphor of a "participant" grants AI a form of agency that it simply doesn't possess. It plays directly into the hands of tech monopolists who want us to think of their products as autonomous beings, which conveniently obscures their own role in designing and profiting from them. He calls AI a "tool, owned by a monopolist, designed to concentrate wealth and power." That, to me, is a much more accurate and useful description than "language game participant."</p>

            <p><strong>David French:</strong> I see his point, and I love the vividness of the language. But I think he’s conflating two different levels of analysis. The manuscript is using "participant" as a philosophical tool to analyze the *function* of AI within a rule-based system. It's an "as if" argument. We analyze it *as if* it were a participant to better understand the social and legal implications of its outputs. Doctorow is making a political and economic argument about the *motives* of the people who own the AI. Both can be true at the same time. You can have a tool that, functionally, participates in a language game, and that tool can be owned by a monopolist who uses it for nefarious purposes.</p>

            <p><strong>Sarah Isgur:</strong> But the language matters, David! If we start talking about AI as a "participant" or a "collaborator," we are already losing the battle. We’re personifying it. We’re giving it a seat at the table. That’s a framing that hugely benefits the people who want to avoid liability. They can say, "Don't blame us, the 'participant' made a mistake." Doctorow’s insistence on calling it a "tool" is a crucial political and legal act. It keeps the locus of responsibility firmly on the humans who build and wield that tool.</p>

            <p><strong>David French:</strong> I don’t disagree that we must keep responsibility on the humans. But we still need a framework for analyzing what happens when that tool produces an output that has legal consequences. The manuscript’s framework gives us a way to do that without getting trapped in the dead end of trying to figure out if the AI is "thinking." I see Doctorow’s critique not as a replacement for the book's analysis, but as a vital, real-world warning about how that analysis can be co-opted by power. Which brings us to his final point.</p>

            <p>(Transition Music)</p>

            <p><strong>Sarah Isgur:</strong> Doctorow’s final critique is the one that sums it all up. He says the book is a map, not a battle plan. And that in the world we live in, we desperately need a battle plan.</p>

            <p><em>(Reading from script)</em> “This book is a vital piece of the puzzle, an excellent map of the intellectual territory. But it’s not a battle plan. And right now, a battle plan is what we desperately need. The real revolution isn't in our heads; it's in breaking up the companies that have a boot on our necks.”</p>

            <p><strong>Sarah Isgur:</strong> This is it. This is the whole ballgame. The book offers this incredibly sophisticated, intellectually rigorous framework for a new legal order. But it has absolutely nothing to say about how we get from here to there, especially when the path is blocked by the most powerful and well-funded corporate entities in human history. The book's answer is that these changes are happening "organically" or through "accidental wisdom." Doctorow says that's nonsense. The only way change happens is through a fight. It’s an argument for political action, for trust-busting, for a kind of aggressive populism against corporate power. And the book’s quiet, academic tone feels completely mismatched to the urgency of that fight.</p>

            <p><strong>David French:</strong> I feel the force of that critique. The world is burning, and this book is a treatise on the physics of combustion. There is a disconnect. But I want to offer a defense of the map. You cannot win a war without a good map. You cannot craft a successful battle plan without understanding the intellectual and legal terrain. Doctorow’s call to "break up the companies" is a political objective. It is not, in itself, a legal argument. The principles in this manuscript—the arguments for procedural accountability, for institutional liability, for grounding law in public practice—are the very things you would need to construct a durable legal case for doing exactly what he wants to do.</p>

            <p><strong>Sarah Isgur:</strong> So you’re saying the book is the "why" and Doctorow is the "how"?</p>

            <p><strong>David French:</strong> In a sense, yes. The book provides the philosophical and legal justification for challenging the status quo. It gives us a coherent reason *why* the way these tech companies operate is illegitimate. Doctorow is providing the call to arms. A battle plan without a map is just a mob running in every direction. A map without a battle plan is an academic exercise. You need both. You need the intellectual rigor of the manuscript to build the legal case, and you need the political courage of Doctorow’s critique to actually fight for it.</p>

            <p><strong>Sarah Isgur:</strong> That’s a very neat and tidy way to resolve the tension, David. A very David French way to have your cake and eat it too.</p>

            <p><strong>David French:</strong> (Chuckles) I do my best.</p>

            <p><strong>Sarah Isgur:</strong> But I think you're right. This critique was so important to discuss because it provides the context that the book is missing. The manuscript gives us a powerful new lens to understand the legal challenges of our time. Doctorow reminds us that these are not just intellectual challenges; they are brutal fights over power and money. And any legal theory that forgets that is doomed to be irrelevant. It’s a necessary dose of realism. It reminds us that ideas are not enough. Those ideas have to be fought for.</p>

            <p><strong>David French:</strong> Amen to that. And that seems like the perfect place to leave this series. With a clear-eyed view of both the principles at stake and the fight that will be required to defend them.</p>
