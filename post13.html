            <p>Sarah Isgur: Welcome back to Advisory Opinions and our series on the manuscript Mind, Machine, and Will. I’m Sarah Isgur, alongside David French.</p>
            <p>David French: It’s great to be here, Sarah, though I have a feeling this is the episode where the gloves really come off.</p>
            <p>Sarah Isgur: I think you’re right. In our first two episodes, we explored the book’s central claim: that our legal system is built on a "philosophical error"—the idea that we can know a person's "inner states." We saw how AI is forcing that issue in copyright law. But today, we’re moving from intellectual property to life and liberty. We’re talking about criminal justice. The book argues that modern neuroscience presents a profound challenge to the very idea of free will, and therefore, to the concepts of blame and punishment. I want to start with the quote that sets the stage for this whole discussion.</p>
            <p>(Reading from script) “...the folk psychological view of free will as the conscious selection of actions by an inner self is rendered deeply problematic by neuroscientific evidence.”</p>
            <p>Sarah Isgur: David, last week I said I was "deeply skeptical." This week, I’ll just say I am in profound and fundamental opposition to where this is going. The "folk psychological view of free will" is just another way of saying personal responsibility. The idea that we, as human beings, make choices and should be held accountable for them. If that’s "deeply problematic," then our entire moral framework, not just our legal system, is built on sand.</p>
            <p>David French: And the authors of this manuscript would say, "Precisely." They would argue that it is built on sand, and that neuroscience is simply revealing the geology to us for the first time. Their argument isn't an attack on responsibility, Sarah; they would say it's an attempt to ground it in reality rather than in a metaphysical myth. The central figure here is the neuroscientist Robert Sapolsky. The book puts his argument front and center. Here’s the key quote:</p>
            <p>(Reading from script) “For Sapolsky the idea of a metaphysically ‘free’ agent capable of transcending causal chains is an illusion. This view resonates deeply with Wittgensteinian dissolution of inner states...”</p>
            <p>David French: This is the core of it. Sapolsky’s argument, based on a lifetime of research, is that there is no moment of pure, uncaused choice. There is no "ghost in the machine." Every decision you make is the inevitable outcome of a vast, complex web of causation: the genes you inherited, the way your brain was wired in childhood, the amount of sleep you got last night, the subtle environmental cues around you right now. You couldn’t have done otherwise. For the authors, this isn't some fringe theory; it's the logical endpoint of scientific inquiry.</p>
            <p>Sarah Isgur: And it’s a moral and legal catastrophe. David, this is not a new idea. This is just old-school, hard determinism dressed up in a lab coat with some fMRI scans. The argument has always been the same: if our actions are predetermined, then we can’t be held morally responsible for them. But a legal system has to operate on the presumption of agency. Without it, there is no justice. There is only… behavior management. You’re not punishing a criminal for a wrong they chose to commit; you’re simply adjusting a malfunctioning biological machine. That is a profoundly dehumanizing vision.</p>
            <p>David French: I agree it’s dehumanizing if you take it to its extreme. But let's engage with the argument on its own terms. The authors are saying our current system is also dehumanizing because it blames people for outcomes they did not, in a meaningful sense, choose. It punishes the person with a brain tumor that erodes impulse control as if they had the same capacity for choice as a healthy individual. It punishes the person raised in a crucible of violence and trauma as if they had the same developmental path as someone raised in a stable, loving home. The book is making a radical call for empathy, grounded in science. It’s saying, "There but for the grace of God—or the grace of a different set of causal inputs—go I."</p>
            <p>Sarah Isgur: But the law already has mechanisms for that! We have insanity defenses. We have mitigating circumstances in sentencing. We have the concept of diminished capacity. These are doctrines designed to account for the very real constraints on human agency without throwing out the concept of agency itself. What this manuscript proposes is not a refinement of those doctrines, but their complete annihilation. It erases the line between the person who struggles against their circumstances and still chooses wrongly, and the person for whom choice is truly impossible. It’s a framework that has no room for virtue, courage, or resilience.</p>
            <p>David French: I think the authors would say it redefines virtue not as a magical act of uncaused will, but as the product of a fortunate set of circumstances that we should seek to replicate for everyone. But let’s move to the legal consequences, because this is where the theory hits the courtroom.</p>
            <p>(Transition Music)</p>
            <p>Sarah Isgur: So, if we accept, for the sake of argument, this deterministic premise, what does it mean for the criminal justice system? The manuscript is brutally clear about the implications. This quote lays it bare:</p>
            <p>(Reading from script) “...retributive punishment—grounded in the notion that people ‘deserve’ to suffer for wrongdoing—cannot be justified if agency and culpability are themselves outcomes of biological, genetic, and social factors beyond conscious control.”</p>
            <p>Sarah Isgur: This is the bottom line. The entire concept of "just deserts," the idea that a person who commits a heinous act deserves to be punished, is, in their view, intellectually and morally bankrupt. David, I cannot overstate how radical this is. The desire for retribution is not some ugly, primitive instinct we need to evolve past. It is a deep-seated human intuition about justice. It's the idea that moral accounts must be balanced. When you tell the family of a murder victim that the killer doesn't deserve to be punished, you are not just violating a legal principle; you are violating a fundamental aspect of their humanity and their need to see the world as a just place.</p>
            <p>David French: I understand the power of that intuition, Sarah, I truly do. But our intuitions can be wrong. For centuries, our intuition was that the sun revolved around the earth. Science challenged that. The authors are arguing that neuroscience is doing the same thing to our intuition about blame. They're saying that the desire for retribution is based on a false premise—the premise of a freely choosing, autonomous self. If that premise is false, then any system built upon it, however emotionally satisfying, is unjust. You are, in essence, punishing a machine for its programming.</p>
            <p>Sarah Isgur: But David, this isn't just an intuition; it's the bedrock of our social contract. We grant the state a monopoly on violence on the condition that it will use that power to enforce a system of justice. Part of that justice is expressing the community’s moral condemnation of wrongful acts. Punishment isn't just about deterrence or rehabilitation; it's a statement. It says, "What you did was wrong, and in this community, that has consequences." This "Justice Without Desert" model has no language for that. It can only say, "Your behavior was suboptimal, and we will now intervene to adjust your future outputs." It’s the language of a technician, not a moral community.</p>
            <p>David French: And the authors would say that is precisely the point. The law should not be in the business of moral condemnation; it should be in the business of harm reduction and public safety. We should be building a system that is forward-looking, not backward-looking. A system that asks, "How can we prevent this from happening again?" not "How can we make the person who did this suffer?" It is a move from a punitive model to a public health model of crime.</p>
            <p>Sarah Isgur: A public health model that has no mechanism for holding individuals accountable as moral agents. That's a price I am not willing to pay. But let’s talk about the alternative they propose. If we're not doing retribution, what are we doing?</p>
            <p>(Transition Music)</p>
            <p>David French: The manuscript doesn't just tear down the old system; it proposes a replacement. They call it the "practice-based alternative," and they connect it to the real-world movement for restorative and reconstructive justice. Here’s the key quote:</p>
            <p>(Reading from script) “The global turn from retribution toward restorative and reconstructive models marks one of the most significant paradigm shifts in contemporary criminal law... The convergence of legal, ethical, and neuroscientific insights underscores the superiority of reconstruction over retribution in building just and resilient societies.”</p>
            <p>David French: So, the alternative to retribution is reconstruction. Instead of focusing on punishment, the system should focus on three things: repairing the harm done to the victim, rehabilitating the offender so they can safely rejoin the community, and addressing the underlying conditions that led to the crime in the first place. This isn't a fantasy, Sarah. Restorative justice programs are being implemented in jurisdictions all over the world, often with remarkable success in reducing recidivism. It's a pragmatic, evidence-based approach.</p>
            <p>Sarah Isgur: It’s an approach that works for certain types of offenses. I have no problem with a restorative justice model for, say, a non-violent property crime committed by a first-time juvenile offender. Bringing the victim and the offender together can be incredibly powerful. But are we really suggesting this model for a serial rapist or a mass murderer? Are we going to sit them down in a "healing circle" with their victims' families? There are some crimes that are so heinous, so destructive, that the only adequate response from a just society is punishment and permanent removal. This model seems to have no category for pure, unadulterated evil.</p>
            <p>David French: The authors would argue that "evil" is a pre-scientific, metaphysical concept. They would say that even the most heinous acts are the product of a broken machine—a brain ravaged by psychopathy, trauma, or genetic misfortune. The response shouldn't be moral condemnation, but incapacitation for the purpose of public safety. You would still have prisons, perhaps even for life, but their justification would be purely utilitarian: we are keeping this person isolated because they are demonstrably dangerous, not because they "deserve" it. The goal is safety, not suffering.</p>
            <p>Sarah Isgur: And that distinction matters immensely. A prison system designed for "quarantine" is fundamentally different from one designed for punishment. It changes how we treat prisoners, what programs we offer, and what hope we hold out for them. But it also changes how society views the crime. It medicalizes evil. And I think there is a profound danger in that. It strips us of our moral language and our ability to call evil by its name. I think that is a regression, not progress.</p>
            <p>David French: And I think continuing to punish people based on a disproven metaphysical concept is a far greater injustice. But the book offers one final, provocative thought that tries to bridge this gap.</p>
            <p>(Transition Music)</p>
            <p>Sarah Isgur: So, David, we’ve reached the core of our disagreement. You’re drawn to the intellectual consistency and the compassionate impulse of this deterministic model. I am repulsed by its moral nihilism and its practical consequences. The book seems to acknowledge this tension in a very interesting way. It suggests that maybe, just maybe, we can’t live without the idea of free will, even if it’s not scientifically real.</p>
            <p>(Reading from script) “The ‘necessary illusion’ of free will for the purposes of maintaining some sense of responsibility and justice can be compared to the ‘necessary illusion’ of authorship as laid out in prior chapters.”</p>
            <p>David French: This is a fascinating move. It’s a concession, of sorts. The authors are acknowledging that society might need to operate as if free will exists to function. Just as they argued that the concept of the "author" is a useful fiction for organizing our copyright system, they're suggesting that "free will" might be a useful fiction for organizing our moral and legal systems. It’s a pragmatic compromise. We know it’s not technically true, but we act as if it is because the alternative is too chaotic.</p>
            <p>Sarah Isgur: That is the most intellectually unsatisfying argument I have ever heard. You can't spend an entire chapter arguing that a concept is a bankrupt, immoral illusion, and then end by saying, "But we should probably keep pretending it's real." That's not a coherent legal philosophy; it's an admission of defeat. If you truly believe that our system of blame and punishment is unjust, you have an obligation to replace it with something better, not to prop up the old system with a "noble lie."</p>
            <p>David French: Or, perhaps it's a recognition of the limits of philosophy and science to dictate social organization. It’s an act of humility. It says, here is what science tells us about the physical world, but we also recognize that human societies are complex systems that operate on shared narratives and beliefs. And maybe the narrative of choice and responsibility, even if it's a simplification of reality, is a necessary one for a free and flourishing society. It leaves us with a profound paradox.</p>
            <p>Sarah Isgur: It leaves us with a mess. And it tees up the question for next week’s episode perfectly. If human responsibility is this fraught, this paradoxical, this dependent on "necessary illusions," what hope do we have for creating a system of accountability for artificial intelligence? AI has no illusions, necessary or otherwise. It is a purely deterministic system. When it causes harm, who is accountable? We can’t fall back on the fictions we use for ourselves.</p>
            <p>David French: Exactly. We'll be forced to confront the question of liability without the comfort of blame. That's next time, on Advisory Opinions.</p>
