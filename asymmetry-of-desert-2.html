            <h2>The Asymmetry of Desert: A Practice-Based Resolution to the Contradiction of Blame and Praise</h2>
            
            <h3>Part I: Deconstructing the Two Poles of the Contradiction</h3>

            <h4>Section 1: The Determined Criminal: Sapolsky's Challenge and Justice Without Desert</h4>
            <p>The contemporary university classroom often serves as a crucible for competing ethical intuitions. One of the most prevalent is a compassionate, scientifically-informed view of criminal behavior, which holds that individuals who commit crimes are often products of forces beyond their control and should therefore be rehabilitated rather than retributively punished. This perspective, while laudable in its empathy, rests on a profound philosophical claim about the nature of human agency—a claim that, if applied consistently, has radical implications for all domains of human achievement. This section will build the strongest possible case for this deterministic view of the criminal, drawing primarily on the neuroscientific arguments of Robert Sapolsky, to establish the first pole of the contradiction that this report seeks to resolve. It will detail the scientific case against libertarian free will and explore its necessary consequence: a system of justice without desert.</p>

            <h5>1.1 The Neuroscientific Case Against Libertarian Free Will</h5>
            <p>The modern argument against free will is powerfully articulated by neuroscientist Robert Sapolsky, who posits that every human action is the result of an unbroken causal chain, leaving no room for an uncaused choice.<sup><a href="#ref1">[1]</a></sup> His central thesis is that "we are nothing more or less than the cumulative biological and environmental luck, over which we had no control, that has brought us to any moment."<sup><a href="#ref2">[2]</a></sup> This deterministic framework is often visualized with the metaphor of "turtles all the way down," signifying that there are only antecedent causes stretching back in time.<sup><a href="#ref3">[3]</a></sup> The analysis of any given action reveals a cascade of determining factors operating on different timescales, from neurobiological events in the preceding seconds to the deep evolutionary history that shaped the human brain. Each layer of this complex web adds another constraint, another determining influence, until the space for an independent, freely willing self disappears entirely.</p>

            <h5>1.2 Justice Without Desert: The Ethical Implications of Determinism</h5>
            <p>If individuals are not the ultimate authors of their actions, the entire edifice of retributive justice—which is predicated on the idea that people <em>deserve</em> blame and punishment—collapses. In a world without free will, concepts like praise and blame "make no sense whatsoever as virtues."<sup><a href="#ref4">[4]</a></sup> Hating a person for a crime they were determined to commit becomes as irrational as "hating the sky for storming."<sup><a href="#ref5">[5]</a></sup> The necessary alternative is a "public health" or "quarantine" model of justice, which dispenses with moral condemnation and focuses instead on pragmatic, forward-looking goals: preventing future harm and rehabilitating individuals where possible.<sup><a href="#ref6">[6]</a></sup></p>

            <h4>Section 2: The Romantic Artist: Merit, Moral Luck, and the Social Construction of Genius</h4>
            
            <h5>2.1 Deconstructing the "Romantic Author"</h5>
            <p>In stark contrast to the criminal, the artist is typically viewed through a libertarian lens as a unique genius deserving of praise and reward. This ideal of the "Romantic author" emerged in the late 18th and early 19th centuries as a reaction against Enlightenment rationalism, championing emotion, imagination, and the subjective self as the ultimate source of creative truth.<sup><a href="#ref7">[7]</a></sup> William Wordsworth, in his preface to <em>Lyrical Ballads</em>, famously defined poetry as "the spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings," arguing that the poet is a "man speaking to men" but one endowed with a "more lively sensibility" and a "more comprehensive soul."<sup><a href="#ref8">[8]</a></sup> This ideology elevates the artist to a quasi-religious figure whose value lies in the authentic expression of their inner states.<sup><a href="#ref9">[9]</a></sup> However, this myth is philosophically unstable and has been systematically dismantled by thinkers like Michel Foucault, who argues that the "author" is not a real person but an "author function"—a social construct that emerged to serve regulatory needs.<sup><a href="#ref20">[20]</a></sup></p>

            <h5>2.2 The Role of Luck in Artistic Achievement: Moral Luck</h5>
            <p>The concept of "moral luck," developed by philosophers Thomas Nagel and Bernard Williams, reveals that artistic achievement is profoundly shaped by factors beyond an agent's control.<sup><a href="#ref10">[10]</a></sup> Nagel identifies four kinds of luck that apply directly to the artist: <strong>constitutive luck</strong> (innate talents), <strong>circumstantial luck</strong> (the environment one is born into), <strong>causal luck</strong> (the broader problem of determinism), and <strong>resultant luck</strong> (how one's projects turn out).<sup><a href="#ref11">[11]</a></sup> Williams's famous thought experiment involving the painter Paul Gauguin, who abandons his family for his art, illustrates that the justification for his decision depends entirely on his eventual success—an outcome contingent on luck.<sup><a href="#ref12">[12]</a></sup> The moral and aesthetic value we assign to an artist's life and work is contingent on factors beyond their control.</p>

            <h5>2.3 The Social and Economic Determinants of Artistic Success</h5>
            <p>Sociological and economic evidence further supports this deterministic view. Artistic success is not a direct measure of raw talent but is mediated by a powerful institutional system of galleries, museums, and critics.<sup><a href="#ref13">[13]</a></sup> Sir Alan Bowness, a former director of the Tate, proposed a deterministic sequence of "conditions of success" for artists, arguing that fame is predictable and constructed by this system.<sup><a href="#ref14">[14]</a></sup> The artist, like the criminal, is a product of a dense web of causation, exposing the core inconsistency in our views: if we absolve the criminal of blame because their actions are determined, we must also absolve the artist of praise.</p>

            <h3>Part II: A Unified Framework for Agency and Responsibility</h3>
            
            <h4>Section 3: The Wittgensteinian Revolution: From Inner States to Public Practice</h4>
            <p>The resolution to the paradox lies in abandoning the backward-looking framework of desert and adopting a consistent, forward-looking, and instrumental view of both praise and blame. This approach, rooted in the philosophy of Ludwig Wittgenstein, rejects the "inner-state" model of agency and relocates meaning in public, social practice.<sup><a href="#ref6">[6]</a></sup> In this framework, concepts like understanding, intention, and creativity are not private mental events but abilities demonstrated through competent participation in shared, rule-governed activities. Agency, in this view, is not a property of a solitary self but a social achievement, a status conferred upon those who can successfully participate in the practices that constitute our shared form of life.</p>

            <h4>Section 4: Resolving the Paradox: A Consistent, Forward-Looking Ethic</h4>

            <h5>4.1 The Psychological Asymmetry of Praise and Blame</h5>
            <p>The asymmetrical reception of these parallel critiques reveals a deep contradiction, but it also has psychological roots. Research shows that blame and praise are not mirror images; blame judgments tend to be more "extreme" and "differentiated."<sup><a href="#ref27">[27]</a></sup> We scrutinize the agent's control and intentions far more closely for a negative act than for a positive one, a bias likely rooted in the evolutionary need to regulate threats to the community.<sup><a href="#ref28">[28]</a></sup> Our intuitive moral psychology is biased toward a more intense and analytical focus on negative deviations from social norms.</p>

            <h5>4.2 A Consistent Ethic: Praise and Blame as Social Technologies</h5>
            <p>The resolution lies in moving from this intuitive morality to a philosophically consistent one by reframing the social function of praise and blame. We stop asking the metaphysical question, "What does this person truly deserve?" and start asking the pragmatic, social question, "What kind of behavior do we as a community want to encourage or discourage?"</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>For Criminals:</b> We should not blame them in a retributive sense, but we should intervene to protect the community and encourage pro-social behavior. The focus is entirely forward-looking.</li>
                <li><b>For Artists:</b> We should not praise them because they metaphysically "deserve" it. We should praise and reward them <em>because doing so incentivizes the creation of art</em>, which our society deems valuable. The system of rewards is a social technology designed to encourage productive behavior.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This unified framework provides a consistent, pragmatic, and philosophically robust answer to the initial challenge, one that retains a place for both compassion in our justice system and celebration in our cultural life, but grounds both in a coherent, unified framework.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion: The Social Function of Agency in a Determined World</h3>
            <p>This analysis began by deconstructing the contradictory ways we view criminals and artists. The deterministic view of the criminal, grounded in neuroscience, leads to a justice system without desert. The libertarian view of the artist was dismantled using moral luck and sociology, revealing that "merit" is as philosophically unstable as "blame."</p>
            <p>The resolution was found by shifting the philosophical framework away from a flawed "inner-state" model of agency to a practice-based model where agency is a public, social achievement. This allows for a consistent, forward-looking ethic where both praise and blame are social technologies. We intervene in the lives of criminals to build a safer society. We reward artists to incentivize the creation of art. In a world without libertarian free will, agency is not lost; it is relocated from the private mind to the public arena of social practice. Responsibility and merit become the pragmatic tools a community uses to shape its collective future, providing a more coherent and compassionate foundation for both justice and art.</p>
