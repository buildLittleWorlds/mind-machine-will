            <p>(Intro Music with an academic, slightly classical feel fades in and then fades out)</p>

            <p><strong>Sarah Isgur:</strong> Welcome back to Advisory Opinions. I’m Sarah Isgur, and I am once again joined by David French for what I am now calling the never-ending podcast series on the manuscript *Mind, Machine, and Will*.</p>

            <p><strong>David French:</strong> (Chuckles) It’s the gift that keeps on giving, Sarah. Just when you think you’ve wrestled the philosophical beast to the ground, it sprouts another head.</p>

            <p><strong>Sarah Isgur:</strong> It really does. Last week, we discussed a critique from Cory Doctorow that brought a much-needed dose of realism about power and money. Today, we’re going in a completely different direction. We’ve received a three-part critique from a perspective that can only be described as… well, deeply academic. It’s a dense, critical theory take, invoking Foucault and Agamben. The author argues that the book’s vision isn't a liberation from old ideas, but the blueprint for a new, more perfect prison. David, I’m going to be honest. A lot of this went right over my head. It is filled with terms like "biopower," "homo sacer," and the "state of exception." I need you to be my translator.</p>

            <p><strong>David French:</strong> I will do my best. It is a very different kind of critique from Doctorow’s. He saw a street fight. This author sees a quiet, administrative coup d'état. The core of the argument is that the book's proposed shift from "inner states" to "public practices" isn't a revolution at all. It's the perfection of a modern form of power. Here's the quote from the first part that I think sums up the entire critique:</p>

            <p><em>(Reading from script)</em> “What they describe is not a revolution that overthrows power, but a reformation that perfects it. The move from the 'inner state' to 'public practice' is not a liberation from control; it is the perfection of a disciplinary society.”</p>

            <p><strong>David French:</strong> The argument is that the "inner state"—our private thoughts and intentions—was the last messy, unpredictable refuge from a system that wants to observe and manage everything. By making "public practice" the only thing that matters, we make the entire human subject transparent and available to power. There's no place left to hide. We become, in this view, perfectly governable subjects.</p>

            <p><strong>Sarah Isgur:</strong> Okay, that part I get. And I see the connection to my own skepticism. I’ve been worried this whole time about the loss of the individual, about a system that reduces people to their observable functions. This critique just takes that fear and puts it in a much more sinister, philosophical frame. It’s not just a bad idea; it's a "disciplinary apparatus." But what I don’t understand is the next leap—this idea of "biopower" and the "camp." It feels like a pretty dramatic escalation.</p>

            <p><strong>David French:</strong> It is, and it’s a hallmark of this style of theory. Let’s try to break it down.</p>

            <p>(Transition Music)</p>
            
            <p><strong>David French:</strong> The second part of the critique introduces the Italian philosopher Giorgio Agamben and his distinction between two kinds of life: *zoe* and *bios*. *Zoe* is just bare, biological life—the fact that you’re a breathing organism. *Bios* is your political life, your life as a citizen with rights and meaning. The argument is that the ultimate power of the state—sovereign power—is the power to strip a person of their *bios*, reducing them to *zoe*, or "bare life," which can then be managed or disposed of without legal consequence. The ultimate space where this happens is what Agamben calls the "camp."</p>

            <p><strong>Sarah Isgur:</strong> So, like a concentration camp?</p>
            
            <p><strong>David French:</strong> That's the historical archetype, yes. But for these theorists, the "camp" is a broader concept. It’s any space where law is suspended and people are treated as objects of administration rather than as subjects of rights. And this is the critic’s stunning accusation against the manuscript. They argue that the world described in *Mind, Machine, and Will* is a new kind of camp. Here’s the quote from the second post:</p>

            <p><em>(Reading from script)</em> “The world they describe is not a 'post-Cartesian' utopia; it is the realization of a biopolitical project that has been at the heart of our tradition from the very beginning. What this manuscript provides is not a guide to living after the Cartesian ghost, but a blueprint for the ultimate camp—a zone of indistinction where human life is perfectly and absolutely captured by a new kind of sovereign power.”</p>

            <p><strong>Sarah Isgur:</strong> Okay, wow. That is… a take. So, the argument is that when the book champions the neuroscientific view of humans as determined biological machines, it’s reducing us to "bare life," or *zoe*. And when it says our agency only comes from our "participation in public practices," it's saying the system grants us a qualified political life, or *bios*, only on the condition that we perform correctly. If we fail, we are deemed "incompetent" and become objects of "rehabilitation"—we’re reduced back to bare life to be managed by the system. So, the whole world becomes an "algorithmic camp."</p>

            <p><strong>David French:</strong> That's the argument in a nutshell. It’s a powerful and deeply pessimistic reading. It sees the manuscript’s call for a more rational, humane, and evidence-based system of justice not as progress, but as the perfection of a totalitarian form of control. It sees the "therapeutic" state as more dangerous than the punitive one, because it’s more total. It doesn't just punish your body; it seeks to re-engineer your very being.</p>

            <p><strong>Sarah Isgur:</strong> I have to say, David, as someone who has worked in government, this is so far removed from the reality of how these systems work that it feels like an intellectual parlor game. The idea that the Department of Justice or the Copyright Office is operating as some kind of grand "biopolitical apparatus" for managing "bare life" is just... absurd. These are messy, inefficient, underfunded bureaucracies staffed by people trying to do their jobs. They are not the architects of a seamless, all-encompassing "camp." This critique is so abstract that it loses all contact with the real world. It’s a ghost story for academics.</p>

            <p><strong>David French:</strong> And I think that's the fundamental divide between our legal-realist world and the world of critical theory. We see institutions as flawed, contingent human creations. They see them as manifestations of deep, impersonal structures of power. But while I share your skepticism about the grandiosity of the language, I think we shouldn't dismiss the warning too quickly. Is there not a danger in a system that becomes purely therapeutic and managerial? Is there not a risk in a world where every human problem is seen as a technical glitch to be fixed?</p>

            <p><strong>Sarah Isgur:</strong> Of course there is. But that’s a debate we can have using the language of law, liberty, and limited government. We don't need to invoke "homo sacer" and the "state of exception" to do it. This critique seems to have only one tool in its toolbox—the hammer of totalitarianism—and so every problem looks like a nail. But it does lead to their final point, which is their proposed solution. Or rather, their non-solution.</p>

            <p>(Transition Music)</p>
            
            <p><strong>Sarah Isgur:</strong> So, after arguing that the manuscript is a blueprint for a totalizing "algorithmic camp," the critic has to offer an alternative. And their alternative is… well, it’s not exactly a five-point plan for legislative reform. This is from the final post:</p>

            <p><em>(Reading from script)</em> “The task is not to build more 'ethical,' 'transparent,' and 'participatory' practices. The task is to discover and cultivate what Agamben might call a 'form-of-life'—a way of being and acting that cannot be resolved into the biopolitical distinction between bare life (zoe) and political function (bios)... It is to think a human existence that is not reducible to either bare, biological fact or to a qualified, political status.”</p>
            
            <p><strong>David French:</strong> (Sighs) And this is where this school of thought so often ends. Having deconstructed everything, having shown that all our institutions are prisons and all our reforms are just new forms of control, they are left with… a vague, poetic call to "render the machine inoperative" and invent a new "form-of-life." It's a politics of pure refusal.</p>

            <p><strong>Sarah Isgur:</strong> It’s not a politics at all! It’s an abdication. It’s standing on the sidelines and critiquing the players on the field without ever proposing a single workable play. It’s easy to be a purist when you have no responsibility for the outcome. Those of us who actually have to build and maintain a functioning legal system don’t have that luxury. We have to make the hard choices. We have to balance competing values. We have to live in the world as it is. This critique offers no guidance, no path forward, just a romantic and ultimately empty gesture of refusal.</p>

            <p><strong>David French:</strong> I agree. This is where the critique collapses under the weight of its own totalizing claims. And it’s where the manuscript, for all its flaws, proves its worth. The authors of *Mind, Machine, and Will* are engaged in the difficult, messy, practical work of trying to build a better set of rules for the world we actually live in. Their solutions may be imperfect, as you’ve pointed out, but they are tangible. They are proposals that can be debated, tested, and implemented. This critique, on the other hand, offers only a metaphysical escape hatch.</p>

            <p><strong>Sarah Isgur:</strong> It’s the ultimate "ivory tower" critique. It’s intellectually fascinating, I suppose, in the way a black hole is fascinating. It just sucks everything in and lets nothing out. It gives us no tools for making our world better, only for feeling intellectually superior about its inevitable collapse. But I do think this was a useful exercise. It shows the outer limits of where this kind of thinking can go.</p>

            <p>(Transition Music)</p>
            
            <p><strong>David French:</strong> So, to close out this mailbag and our series, we've now looked at two very different critiques of the manuscript. One from Cory Doctorow, which was a passionate, grounded call to recognize the role of power and money. And one from this anonymous critical theorist, which was a sweeping, abstract argument that the book’s reforms are a new form of totalitarianism.</p>

            <p><strong>Sarah Isgur:</strong> And it’s interesting, David. I found Doctorow’s critique to be a vital and necessary corrective. It provided the real-world context the book was missing. This critique, on the other hand, I found to be almost entirely unhelpful. It operates at such a high level of abstraction that it’s completely disconnected from the practical challenges of law and governance. It’s a critique that is more interested in its own theoretical purity than in making a tangible difference in the world.</p>

            <p><strong>David French:</strong> I think that's right. And it brings me back to my deep appreciation for the American legal tradition, for all its flaws. It is a tradition that is fundamentally pragmatic. It is about solving real problems for real people. It is grounded in the common law, in procedure, in the slow, iterative work of building and maintaining a system of ordered liberty. The manuscript, at its best, is a part of that tradition. It is trying to update our legal software to run on the new hardware of the 21st century. This critique, on the other hand, wants to burn the whole thing down and hope that a beautiful new "form-of-life" magically rises from the ashes.</p>

            <p><strong>Sarah Isgur:</strong> And that’s a risk I’m not willing to take. So, I think we can finally, definitively, close the book on this series. It’s been a fascinating detour into the world of philosophy, but I, for one, am ready to get back to the comforting solidity of cert petitions and circuit splits.</p>

            <p><strong>David French:</strong> Me too. Thanks for taking the journey, Sarah.</p>
