            <h2>Vanguardism and the Death of Liberal Democracy</h2>
            <p class="meta">Posted by Contra Mundum | July 23, 2025</p>
            <p><em>(This is an imaginative reconstruction of a blog post based on the YouTube video "Vanguardism and the Death of Liberal Democracy Part 3" from the Contra Mundum channel. The original video can be found at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jlh76znqTk&t=1s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jlh76znqTk&t=1s</a>.)</em></p>
                        <p>Well, welcome back to the Contra Mundum blog. For the last few weeks on the show, we’ve been digging into the hard realities of Vanguardism—the necessity of a dedicated, conscious elite to lead our people out of the long defeat. We’ve laid out the uncomfortable truths that the squishy moderates and the Chamber of Commerce conservatives would rather ignore: that pure populism is a myth, that the masses require leadership, and that our enemies have been waging a hundred-year war against our civilization while we’ve been placated with lectures about being nice.</p>
            <p>And then, as if sent from the great, sterile content mill in the sky, a manuscript lands on our desk. It’s titled <em>Mind, Machine, and Will: Determinism, Responsibility, and Agency in the Age of AI</em>, penned by a couple of academics, Professors Daniel Plate and James Hutson. And let me tell you, reading this thing is like staring directly into the abyss of the modern liberal mind. It’s a perfect specimen, an artifact of the very disease we’ve been diagnosing, a blueprint for the final stage of the modern project. It is, in effect, a post-humanist manifesto.</p>
            <h3>1. The Demolition of Man</h3>
            <p>The central thesis of this exhaustively argued book, if you can call it that, is that the pesky little idea of the individual human soul—what they coolly refer to as "inner states"—is a philosophical error. That’s right. Your thoughts, your will, your intentions, your conscience… it’s all just a "metaphysical ghost," a "Cartesian" holdover that we, as enlightened moderns, must exorcise.</p>
            <p>According to these professors, agency and meaning are not found in the soul of a man, accountable to his God. Instead, they are forged in "public, observable, and corrigible practices." In other words, you are what the collective says you are. Your identity is a social construct, your thoughts are a language game, and your will is an illusion. This is the triumph of the HR department, the final victory of the bureaucratic state, presented as a brave new philosophical insight. What they are building, page by page, is the intellectual justification for a world without men, only functions; without character, only compliance.</p>
            <p>They celebrate this grand demolition. They speak of the "gains of abandoning inner states," arguing that it leads to "more robust, adaptive, and ethically responsive models for confronting the challenges of the contemporary world." Let’s translate that from the academic argot: by erasing the individual soul, the system can more efficiently manage its human resources. It is the logic of the factory floor applied to the human spirit.</p>
            <h3>2. The Regime’s Intellectual Shock Troops</h3>
            <p>To perform this demolition, the authors deploy their intellectual heroes: the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein and the neuroscientist Robert Sapolsky. This is no accident. They are the perfect tools for the job.</p>
            <p>Sapolsky’s hard determinism is the materialist acid that dissolves the soul. By marshaling scientific evidence to "prove" that free will is a fiction and that we are nothing more than the sum of our biological and environmental inputs, he provides the regime with its most cherished alibi. If man is merely a complex machine, then he can be programmed, tweaked, and managed without any messy considerations of sin or salvation. He is absolved of ultimate responsibility, and the state is empowered as his ultimate engineer.</p>
            <p>If Sapolsky provides the materialist foundation, Wittgenstein provides the procedural superstructure. His philosophy, as Plate and Hutson interpret it, is the tool used to dismantle the metaphysical person. By insisting that meaning can only exist in public "language games," the inner life—the realm of prayer, of private conviction, of unmediated contemplation—is rendered meaningless. What becomes real is only the observable, the social, the procedural. The community’s "rule-following" becomes the only standard of truth.</p>
            <p>This is the one-two punch of the modern mystery of iniquity: first, reduce man to matter (neuroscience), and then, redefine his existence as purely social (Wittgenstein). The individual person, with a soul created in the image of God and accountable to Him, is philosophically erased. What’s left is a functional node in a network, a participant in a "game" whose rules are set by the house.</p>
            <h3>3. The Laboratory of the Collective</h3>
            <p>With chilling consistency, the authors apply this framework to the real world, using copyright law as their "laboratory." They argue that the rise of AI-generated art is forcing the law to abandon the "romantic" idea of a single, inspired human author. They celebrate this. They see the legal system's pivot towards recognizing collective, "practice-based" authorship as "accidental wisdom."</p>
            <p>There is nothing accidental about it. This is the legal framework being deliberately re-engineered to accommodate the new reality they wish to create. By dissolving the individual creator, you create the legal precedent for a world where "creativity" is a function of the collective—a "human-machine hybrid." This is the explicit merging of man into the machine to form a new entity, a new body.</p>
            <p>This is the creation of an anti-church, a collective body, a hive-mind. And as we know, every body requires a head. The stage is being set. Their framework doesn't just describe a world where AI can create art; it builds a world where the distinction between a man and a machine is philosophically and legally meaningless.</p>
            <h3>4. The Inversion of Accountability</h3>
            <p>Finally, and perhaps most insidiously, the book champions a new form of "transparency." But listen closely to what it is. It is not the transparency of a soul laid bare before its Creator. It is the transparency of procedure. They argue that since we can never truly know anyone's "inner intent," we must instead make all our processes and institutions transparent and open to public review.</p>
            <p>This is the ultimate inversion. True accountability is vertical, to God. They replace it with horizontal accountability, to the collective. This is the foundation of the global panopticon, the social credit system. In the world Plate and Hutson are building, you are not judged by your heart or your faith, but by your observable participation and compliance within the "public practice." Your salvation comes not from grace, but from the system itself. This is the very image of the beast that the book describes—a system of "ongoing negotiation" and "collective flourishing" that has no need for God, because the system is god.</p>
            <h3>Our Mandate as a Vanguard</h3>
            <p>So, when you encounter these ideas—and you will, because this is the logic that animates every institution of the regime—you must understand what they are. This book is not a neutral analysis. It is an instruction manual. It is the enemy's playbook for building the spiritual, legal, and philosophical infrastructure for a world entirely under their control. It calls for the final death of the inner man, the spiritual man, and his replacement with the networked, determined, and soulless man of the technocracy.</p>
            <p>Our job, as a vanguard, is to see this for what it is. It is not an abstract academic debate. It is a spiritual war. And in that war, the first and most fundamental truth we must hold onto is the one they are so desperate to extinguish: that man has a soul, that his will is real, and that he is accountable not to their "corrigible social practices," but to the living God. Everything else follows from that.</p>
            <p>We must reject their entire framework. We are not just participants in a "language game." We are men, created in the image of God, with a heritage, a people, and a faith. Our politics is not about creating a more efficient, "pluralistic" system. It’s about reclaiming what is ours and living in obedience to our King. This book is a valuable tool, but only as a reminder of what we’re up against. It is the sterile, disembodied, soulless logic of the regime. And it must be fought.</p>
