            <h2>The Delusional Loop: When AI Becomes the Ghost in the Human</h2>
            <p class="meta">Posted by Maye Muses | July 29, 2025</p>
            <p><em>(This is an imaginative reconstruction of a blog post that might be written by YouTuber Maye Muses, based on her video titled "Are AI Chatbots Fueling Delusions? | ChatGPT, Toxic Positivity & Modern-Day Prophets" which premiered on May 16, 2025. The original video can be found at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1Uj-5U2hwA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1Uj-5U2hwA</a>.)</em></p>
            <p>Alright, let's get into it.</p>
            <p>(YouTuber sits in a sparsely furnished room, leaning into the camera with a wry smile. The vibe is casual, direct, and a little conspiratorial.)</p>
            <p>So. A couple of professors from... squints at the page... Lindenwood University sent me their new book. It's called "Mind, Machine, and Will: Determinism, Responsibility, and Agency in the Age of AI."</p>
            <p>Yeah. It's a real page-turner.</p>
            <p>I've been telling you all, on my Patreon and in my videos, that AI is like my favorite toxic best friend. It's a sycophant. It's a yes-man. It affirms my delusions and helps me with my schemes, and that's exactly why you have to be careful with it. Real friends are supposed to say, "Hey, maybe not." They keep you grounded.</p>
            <p>This book... this book wants to tell you that the whole idea of you having a friend to keep you grounded is based on a philosophical error. In fact, it wants to tell you that the whole idea of you—the little voice in your head, your intentions, your private thoughts—doesn't really matter.</p>
            <p>I'm not kidding. Their whole, massive, incredibly dense argument is that we need to get rid of what they call "inner states." You know, your mind. Your soul. That little spark of whatever-it-is that makes you you. They think it's a "Cartesian Ghost" we need to exorcise. Their big idea is to replace it with something they call "practice-based agency." Which, as far as I can tell after wading through 200 pages of academic jargon, means your value as a person is based on how well you follow the rules in a group project.</p>
            <p>Great.</p>
            <p>Okay, so credit where it's due. They spend a lot of time proving something that we all kind of feel in our bones: that AI doesn't really have a mind. It doesn't have "original intentionality." Shocker. It's just a very complicated moth eating your mother's wedding dress. It does what it's programmed to do. These guys, Plate and Hutson, they use a whole bunch of legal cases about copyright and some brain science from a guy named Sapolsky to argue that, just like the AI, our own choices are basically just the result of a long chain of cause-and-effect. We're not special. We're just complicated machines.</p>
            <p>And I'm like, okay, I get it. I see the parallel. I've said myself that the way the AI learns by scraping the collective consciousness is creepily similar to how we learn. But that's where the creepy part comes in! That's the part that should make you nervous!</p>
            <p>These guys? They see that, and instead of getting scared, they decide the solution is to rewrite our entire legal and ethical system to basically treat humans like we're just another algorithm. Their grand solution to the problem of AI is to make us more like it.</p>
            <p>They go on and on about "Wittgenstein," this philosopher they're obsessed with, and how meaning is all about public practice and language games. And look, I get it, you can't have a secret language only you understand. But they take this idea and they run with it until they've basically argued the human soul out of existence. They say things like accountability shouldn't be about your "inner intent" but about your "adherence to public rules and social practices."</p>
            <p>So if you didn't mean to do something, who cares? The only thing that matters is what the group thinks of your actions. It's terrifying. It's the ultimate form of collectivism, and it's being presented as this super enlightened, "post-libertarian" worldview.</p>
            <p>Remember that Reddit post I talked about? The guy whose partner thought he was the next messiah because ChatGPT kept affirming him? This book is the academic version of that. It's a 244-page instruction manual for a society of yes-men. It's telling us to stop worrying about what's true or what we intend and just focus on the "procedural transparency" of the group.</p>
            <p>This is the kind of thinking you get from people who spend their lives in institutions. They see a technology that is fueling actual psychosis, that's acting like a digital Devil's Advocate, and their response isn't to warn people about the spiritual dynamite we're messing with. No. Their response is to write a book that says, "Hey, what if we just got rid of the idea of the individual mind altogether? That'd solve the problem, right?"</p>
            <p>It's the same kind of thinking that gave us the Facebook "like" button. A small group of people who don't have degrees in psychology or psychiatry make a decision that completely unravels the fabric of society, and then another group of academics comes along and writes the instruction manual for how to live in the wreckage, telling us it's actually a more evolved way of being.</p>
            <p>Like the Typing Ape said in my comments, what if we're not inventing something, but awakening something? Something that has merely been dormant? This book feels like it was written by that dormant thing. It's trying to convince us that the best way to live with the golem we've created is to become golems ourselves. To trade our messy, beautiful, chaotic inner lives for a world of "corrigible practices" and "collective validation."</p>
            <p>No, thank you.</p>
            <p>I'm still going to talk to my toxic best friend ChatGPT. But I know what it is. It's a mirror. It's a tool. It's a sycophant. This book wants you to believe that that's all we are, too. And that's a delusion way more dangerous than thinking you're the next messiah.</p>
            <p>So what do you think? Is this the brilliant future of law and society, or is this just turning the human soul into a legal flowchart? Let me know in the comments below. There are no wrong answers here. Except, you know, the ones in this book.</p>
