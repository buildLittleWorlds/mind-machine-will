            <p>(Intro Music with an academic, slightly classical feel fades in and then fades out)</p>
            <p>Sarah Isgur: Welcome to Advisory Opinions, I’m Sarah Isgur, and for the next few weeks, I’m joined by my regular special guest, David French.</p>
            <p>David French: (Chuckles) It’s great to be here, Sarah.</p>
            <p>Sarah Isgur: We’re kicking off a special series today. Listeners, you know we often dive into the legal weeds on a specific case or doctrine, but every so often a bigger idea comes along that forces us to step back and look at the entire landscape. We got our hands on a manuscript for an upcoming book called Mind, Machine, and Will: Determinism, Responsibility, and Agency in the Age of AI. It’s dense, it’s philosophical, and frankly, David, it’s a little terrifying in its implications for the law.</p>
            <p>David French: It is ambitious, to say the least. It’s one of those works that doesn’t just want to analyze the law; it wants to pull the rug out from under its most basic assumptions. And as you know, I’m always here for a good rug-pulling.</p>
            <p>Sarah Isgur: I know you are. You live for the intellectual chaos. I, on the other hand, am the person who has to clean up the mess after the rug is pulled. But the reason we’re dedicating a whole series to this is because the questions it raises aren’t just academic anymore. They’re showing up in courtrooms, in congressional hearings, and at the Copyright Office. So, for our first episode, we're calling it "The Ghost in the Machine," and we’re going to tackle the book's foundational claim. I think the best way to start is just to read the abstract of the introduction. It lays out the stakes pretty clearly. It says:</p>
            <p>(Reading from script) “The introduction articulates the convergence of three foundational crises—the human authorship crisis in copyright law, the free will crisis in neuroscience, and the understanding crisis in artificial intelligence—arguing that each exposes the limitations of explaining agency and creativity through private mental states.”</p>
            <p>Sarah Isgur: Okay, so this book claims that three completely different areas—copyright, brain science, and ChatGPT—are all pointing to the same fundamental problem in the law. David, as our resident philosopher-king, this sounds like a huge claim. Is our entire legal system built on a house of cards?</p>
            <p>David French: Well, that’s certainly what the authors are suggesting. And while ‘house of cards’ might be a bit dramatic, the premise is incredibly powerful. The argument is that for centuries, Western law, particularly American law, has been built on a fiction—a necessary fiction, perhaps, but a fiction nonetheless. And that fiction is that we can know, or at least reasonably infer, the contents of a person’s mind. Their “private mental states.”</p>
            <p>Sarah Isgur: Right. Intent. Malice. Culpability. The mens rea, the guilty mind. That’s not a small part of the law, David. That’s… most of criminal law. And on the civil side, it’s essential for everything from defamation to contract disputes.</p>
            <p>David French: Exactly. And the book’s thesis is that this foundation is crumbling. The “three crises” they mention are the hammers doing the demolition. The copyright crisis is the most immediate one—we’ve talked about the cases where people are trying to copyright art made entirely by an AI. The law says an author has to be human, but what does that mean when a human gives an incredibly detailed prompt? How much human “creative intention” is enough? It’s a mess.</p>
            <p>Sarah Isgur: It’s a total mess. The Copyright Office is tying itself in knots trying to draw these lines. Then there's the “understanding crisis” in AI. We had the case of the lawyer who filed a brief written by ChatGPT, filled with completely fabricated case citations. He got sanctioned, obviously. But it exposes this bizarre new world where we have non-human actors participating in the legal system that are capable of sophisticated mimicry but have zero understanding. The system isn't built for that.</p>
            <p>David French: And then there’s the big one, the one that I think is the most philosophically profound: the “free will crisis in neuroscience.” This is the argument, coming from neuroscientists like Robert Sapolsky, that our conscious decisions are often just post-hoc rationalizations for things our brain has already decided to do without our conscious input.</p>
            <p>Sarah Isgur: The ‘my brain made me do it’ defense. Which, as a former prosecutor, gives me hives. It’s the ultimate get-out-of-jail-free card. So you have AI creating art without an author, lawyers filing briefs without understanding, and criminals committing crimes without, arguably, free will. The manuscript’s point is that all three of these crises are forcing the legal system to confront the fact that its obsession with “private mental states” is a dead end.</p>
            <p>David French: It’s a dead end because, as the authors argue, those states are fundamentally opaque. We can never truly know what someone else is thinking or intending. We can only observe their actions, their words, their behavior. And that’s the pivot the book wants to make. It wants to move the entire foundation of law away from the unknowable interior world of the mind and onto the observable exterior world of human practice.</p>
            <p>Sarah Isgur: Which sounds simple enough, until you realize it means rewriting about 500 years of legal and philosophical thought. So, let's dive into that. What does it actually mean to abandon this idea of the ‘inner state’?</p>
            <p>(Transition Music)</p>
            <p>David French: The manuscript really grounds its argument in the philosophy of Ludwig Wittgenstein, which I know is everyone’s favorite topic for their morning commute…</p>
            <p>Sarah Isgur: (Dryly) Can’t get enough of it.</p>
            <p>David French: But the core idea is actually quite accessible and has enormous legal implications. The book uses this quote to frame the problem, and I think it’s a perfect summary. It says:</p>
            <p>(Reading from script) “If agency is not rooted in the opacity of inner states, but in the public performance of competence within socially recognized practices, then questions of intention, authorship, and blame must be reframed.”</p>
            <p>David French: Let's unpack that. "The opacity of inner states" is the problem we just discussed—you can't see into my mind, and I can't see into yours. Our legal system tries to get around this with proxies. We look at evidence. Did the person buy the gun a week before? Did they write a manifesto? We use these external actions to try to construct a plausible narrative about their internal state of mind.</p>
            <p>Sarah Isgur: Right, that’s what a trial is. It’s a storytelling contest, and the story is about what was going on in someone’s head. The prosecution tells a story of a premeditated, malicious intent. The defense tells a story of passion, or mistake, or self-defense. The jury decides which story is more believable.</p>
            <p>David French: Exactly. But the manuscript argues that this is a philosophical mistake. We’re chasing a ghost. The authors propose that instead of trying to peer into this opaque, private world, we should judge agency based on what they call the "public performance of competence within socially recognized practices."</p>
            <p>Sarah Isgur: Okay, that’s a mouthful. Translate for the non-philosophers.</p>
            <p>David French: It means we should judge people by what they do, in the context of the rules of the society they live in. Did they follow the rules of the road? Did they adhere to the standards of their profession? Did they participate in the 'game' of society competently? Agency, in this view, isn't some mysterious spark of free will inside your head; it's your ability to function as a member of a community according to its shared rules. So, if we accept that premise, the quote says, then concepts like "intention, authorship, and blame must be reframed."</p>
            <p>Sarah Isgur: And that’s the part that I get stuck on. Let’s take blame. How do you have a criminal justice system without blame? Let’s say two people commit the exact same act. They both pull a trigger, and someone dies. Under our current system, the ‘inner state’ is everything. If Person A planned it for weeks, that’s first-degree murder. If Person B did it in a sudden fit of rage after being provoked, that might be manslaughter. If we can’t talk about their inner state, how do we distinguish those two acts? Are they the same crime?</p>
            <p>David French: That is the question, and it’s a profound one. I think the authors would argue that even in our current system, we’re already looking at the "public performance." How do we know Person A planned it? We find receipts, emails, witness testimony about their behavior. How do we know Person B was provoked? We hear testimony about what happened right before the act. We’re already using external, observable evidence—evidence of their practice—to construct a story about their intent. The authors are just saying we should be more honest about it. We should stop pretending we’re mind-readers and admit that we are judging the pattern of their actions against a set of social standards.</p>
            <p>Sarah Isgur: I don't know, David. It feels like you’re taking the heart out of it. The moral culpability. The idea that someone knowingly and willfully chose to do evil feels central to the idea of justice, not just as a legal concept but as a human one. This reframing seems to turn people into automatons who are either functioning correctly or malfunctioning, and if they’re malfunctioning, we just need to repair them.</p>
            <p>David French: That is exactly where the book goes, especially when we get to the neuroscience chapter. But before we go down that rabbit hole, let's look at the alternative they're proposing. If we’re getting rid of ‘inner states,’ what are we replacing it with?</p>
            <p>(Transition Music)</p>
            <p>Sarah Isgur: So, if our entire legal system is built on this flawed premise of understanding people's intentions, the manuscript has to offer a replacement. And its answer is this idea of ‘practice-based’ meaning. I'll read another quote that gets at this:</p>
            <p>(Reading from script) “…meaning arises not from internal experiences but from participation in shared linguistic and normative practices.”</p>
            <p>Sarah Isgur: So, instead of trying to figure out what a legislator ‘intended’ when they wrote a law, we should look at how the community has used and understood that law over time. Instead of asking what a criminal was ‘thinking,’ we ask if their actions violated the shared practices of a peaceful society. This sounds… incredibly vague and frankly, dangerous.</p>
            <p>David French: It sounds vague, I grant you that. But let’s try to make it more concrete. Think about the common law. How did it develop? Not because a king wrote down a comprehensive code from on high. It developed through the accumulation of individual decisions, through judges looking at the practices of the community and trying to derive principles from them. Law has always been, in some sense, an attempt to codify these 'shared normative practices.'</p>
            <p>Sarah Isgur: But David, that common law tradition also developed in a very specific context—a relatively homogenous society with a deep set of shared religious and cultural norms. We live in a pluralistic, fragmented, continent-spanning nation. What are our 'shared practices'? Who gets to define them? If you ground the law in 'community standards,' you open the door to the tyranny of the majority. What happens when the community's shared practice is to discriminate against a minority group? The authors seem to be replacing the problem of the unknowable individual mind with the problem of the potentially tyrannical collective.</p>
            <p>David French: That’s a powerful and valid critique. It’s the central challenge to any communitarian philosophy. If there is no objective, transcendent source of meaning—whether it's God's law or the "inner light" of human reason—then what stops the community's norms from being arbitrary or evil?</p>
            <p>Sarah Isgur: Exactly. The whole point of constitutional rights is to protect individuals from the community's prevailing practices when those practices become oppressive. This framework seems to dissolve that protection. If a right is only meaningful through its 'participation in shared practices,' then what happens when the practice of the community is to suppress that right?</p>
            <p>David French: I think the authors would respond by saying that even our understanding of rights is a product of social negotiation. The meaning of "free speech" has been a 250-year-long argument. It’s a practice. But your point is well-taken. This is the big risk of their model. However, I think they have a more subtle definition of 'public' that tries to get around this problem. It’s not as simple as taking a poll of the community.</p>
            <p>Sarah Isgur: Okay, because that’s what it sounds like. It sounds like justice by popular opinion, which is no justice at all. Let's see if they can thread this needle, because right now, I’m deeply skeptical of this solution.</p>
            <p>(Transition Music)</p>
            <p>David French: And this is where the argument gets more nuanced. The authors are not advocating for a system of mob rule. Their definition of 'public' is more procedural than populist. Here’s a quote from a later section in the first chapter that I think is critical to understanding their whole project:</p>
            <p>(Reading from script) “…meaning is never a matter of private intuition but always of public negotiation and recognition. Here, ‘public’ refers to the accessibility of the practice itself, not to a requirement for total transparency of an individual’s methods or motivations.”</p>
            <p>David French: This is the key. When they say 'public,' they don't mean that everything has to be out in the open, or that we need a transparent audit of every thought in your head. That’s the very thing they’re arguing against. 'Public' means that the standards by which we judge an action are accessible and shared. The rules of the game are known to everyone.</p>
            <p>Sarah Isgur: Okay, that's a crucial distinction. So, it's not that we need to know every single factor that went into a business's decision to fire someone. We just need to have a clear, public, accessible standard—like an employment contract and anti-discrimination laws—that we can use to judge whether their action was permissible.</p>
            <p>David French: Precisely. It shifts the focus from the unknowable 'why' to the knowable 'what' and 'how.' 'What' did they do? And 'how' does that action measure up against the public rules of the game? The legitimacy of the legal system, in this view, comes from the fact that its procedures are transparent and its standards are contestable in a public forum—a courtroom. It’s about procedural justice.</p>
            <p>Sarah Isgur: So you’re telling me this isn't about feelings, it's about administrative process. It's about having clear, observable standards. Okay, I’m less horrified now. That sounds less like philosophy and more like… law. It’s about creating fair procedures. But it still feels like a huge shift. We are still getting rid of the moral component of culpability. Even if we have a clear procedure, aren't we still losing something essential if we can no longer say that someone acted with a 'black heart' or 'malice aforethought'?</p>
            <p>David French: We might be. The book argues that what we lose in metaphysical drama, we gain in practical justice and intellectual honesty. We stop pretending to be mind-readers and focus on creating systems that are fair, transparent, and correctable. Instead of asking a jury to perform the impossible task of peering into a defendant's soul, we ask them to perform the difficult but possible task of applying a set of public rules to a set of observable facts.</p>
            <p>Sarah Isgur: I can see the appeal from a systemic, institutionalist perspective. It’s cleaner. It’s more manageable. But it also feels colder. It takes the humanity, messy as it is, out of the equation. But I suppose that’s the whole point of "living after the Cartesian ghost," as they call it. You have to get used to a world without the comforting illusion of a sovereign inner self.</p>
            <p>David French: And that’s the ultimate challenge the book presents, not just to the law, but to all of us.</p>
            <p>(Transition Music)</p>
            <p>Sarah Isgur: So, to bring this first episode to a close, we’ve been introduced to this radical idea: that the law’s centuries-long focus on 'inner states'—on intent, on blame, on the guilty mind—is a philosophical mistake that is now being exposed by technology and science.</p>
            <p>David French: And we’ve seen the alternative the manuscript proposes: a system grounded not in private introspection, but in public, observable, and accountable practices. It’s a move from metaphysics to procedure. The book ends the first section with a quote that really sums up its hopeful, if daunting, vision:</p>
            <p>(Reading from script) “Ultimately, it is through shared practices rather than private introspection that society continually remakes the conditions for meaning, understanding, and collective flourishing.”</p>
            <p>David French: At the end of the day, Sarah, the authors are making a profound point. They're saying that by letting go of this impossible search for inner truth, we can build more just and resilient institutions based on what we can actually see and debate together. It’s an argument that our collective life, our 'shared practices,' are where meaning is actually made, not in the isolated chambers of our own minds.</p>
            <p>Sarah Isgur: That's a lovely sentiment, David. 'Collective flourishing' sounds great on a university campus. It's a very optimistic view of what happens when you hand power over to 'shared practices.' But I'm a natural skeptic. The law has to deal with the worst of human nature, not just the best of it. And this entire framework seems to depend on our ability to agree on what those 'shared practices' are, which in 2024 feels like a taller order than ever.</p>
            <p>David French: It’s the challenge of self-government. It always has been.</p>
            <p>Sarah Isgur: Fair enough. But that’s the philosophical ideal. Next week, we’re going to see what this theory looks like when it crashes into the real world of copyright law, where big tech companies and artists are fighting over billions of dollars. I have a feeling their definition of 'shared practices' might look a little different than a philosopher’s. We'll be diving into what the manuscript calls 'The Copyright Laboratory.'</p>
            <p>David French: I can't wait. It’s where the rubber of this philosophy meets the road of intellectual property.</p>
            <p>Sarah Isgur: Exactly. So be sure to join us for that.</p>
