            <h2>The Empty Crucible: A Critique of Practice-Based Agency in the Age of AI</h2>
            <p class="meta">Posted by M. Loftin | July 28, 2025</p>
            <p><em>(This is an imaginative reconstruction of a blog post that might be written by author M. Loftin, based on his article <a href="https://www.christiancentury.org/features/trump-s-artificial-images">"Trump's artificial images,"</a> published on June 10, 2025.)</em></p>
            <p>In their formidable and deeply coherent manuscript, <em>Mind, Machine, and Will</em>, Daniel Plate and James Hutson have performed a necessary and elegant philosophical demolition. They have chased the Cartesian ghost—that wispy, private self of inaccessible intentions—out of the house of philosophy and law, and they have turned on all the lights. In its place, they offer us a well-lit, publicly observable room: the world of "practice." Drawing on a formidable synthesis of Wittgenstein's philosophy, Sapolsky's neuroscience, and the pragmatic evolution of copyright law, they argue that agency, meaning, and responsibility are not born in the dark recesses of the mind, but are forged in the "crucible" of our shared, public activities.</p>
            <p>The problem is that the treatment may be worse than the disease. While Plate and Hutson have successfully exorcised the ghost, they have left the machine in its place. Their framework, in its laudable effort to escape the solipsism of the private mind, makes a critical category error: it mistakes the arena of meaning for the source of meaning. By bracketing the role of consciousness, embodied experience, and the generative power of human intentionality (not as a metaphysical secret, but as a phenomenological reality), they have constructed a model of agency that is dangerously thin. It is a framework that, in its radical proceduralism, is philosophically incapable of distinguishing between a genuine participant and a perfect mimic. As such, it provides no intellectual defense against the corrosive, degrading effects of artificial intelligence; on the contrary, it builds a philosophical welcome mat for it.</p>
            <h3>The Philosophical Sleight-of-Hand: From Validation to Generation</h3>
            <p>The power of the Plate and Hutson model lies in its Wittgensteinian foundation. They correctly deploy Wittgenstein’s private language argument to show that the criteria for meaning, understanding, and rule-following must be public. One cannot, in isolation, know if one is using a word correctly or following a rule; that knowledge is dependent on the corrective, corroborating practices of a community. From this, the authors conclude that agency itself is a public construct.</p>
            <p>This is where the philosophical sleight-of-hand occurs. The argument moves seamlessly from the claim that meaning is validated publicly to the much stronger claim that it is constituted publicly. This is a crucial distinction. A scientific discovery may be validated by peer review, but it is not generated by the peer review process. A work of art is understood and interpreted within a community, but the creative impulse does not originate in a committee. The public practice is the necessary condition for the intelligibility and communication of meaning, but it is not its sufficient condition.</p>
            <h3>The Phenomenological Source of Agency</h3>
            <p>To build a true alternative to the Cartesian ghost, we need not abandon the subject, but rather reconceive it. The tradition of phenomenology, particularly the work of Edmund Husserl and Maurice Merleau-Ponty, offers a robust, non-metaphysical account of the human subject as the source of meaning, without resorting to a ghostly "inner state."</p>
            <p>For Husserl, the defining feature of consciousness is intentionality—its directedness, its "aboutness." Consciousness is always consciousness of something. This is not a hidden, private event, but the very structure of our lived experience (Lebenswelt). The meaning of our actions and utterances arises from this fundamental, directed engagement with the world. An AI system, by contrast, lacks this primary intentionality. Its operations are purely syntactic; it manipulates symbols without any genuine "aboutness." It does not intend, it calculates.</p>
            <h3>The Corrosive Power of Simulation: From Blurry Photocopies to Hyperreality</h3>
            <p>What, then, is the danger of a framework that cannot see this distinction? The danger is that it becomes defenseless against the corrosive effect of perfect simulation. If legitimacy is granted based on performance alone, then the simulacrum, once it becomes sophisticated enough, is granted the same status as the original. This is not a neutral event; it is a degrading one.</p>
            <p>The writer Ted Chiang, cited in the manuscript itself, provides the initial metaphor: AI-generated content is like a "blurry photocopy of the internet." Each time the algorithm runs, it feeds its own degraded copies back into the system, making a photocopy of a photocopy. The information, the quality, leaches out. This points to a kind of informational entropy.</p>
            <h3>Conclusion: Defending the Crucible</h3>
            <p>Plate and Hutson have given us a powerful account of a world without a metaphysical soul. But the alternative to a haunted house is not an empty one. Their vision of a "post-Cartesian" order, for all its intellectual rigor, ultimately presents us with an empty crucible. By locating agency and meaning entirely within the procedural forms of social practice, they have created a framework that is philosophically unprepared for a technology that can perfectly mimic those forms without possessing any of the underlying substance.</p>
