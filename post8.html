            <h2>Agamben vs. Foucault (Part 3)</h2>
            <p class="meta">Posted by Theory & Philosophy | July 21, 2025</p>
            <p><em>(This is part 3 of a 3-part imaginative reconstruction of a blog post based on the YouTube video "Giorgio Agamben vs. Michel Foucault" from the Theory & Philosophy channel. The original video can be found at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ekPUzWNbcU&t=399s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ekPUzWNbcU&t=399s</a>.)</em></p>
            <p>To encounter a work as ambitious and intellectually rigorous as Daniel Plate and James Hutson’s <em>Mind, Machine, and Will</em> is to be offered a rare opportunity. The book is not merely a proposal or a synthesis; it is a document of profound, perhaps even unintentional, diagnostic power. It presents itself as a solution, a "unified framework" to guide us out of the crises born from the collision of neuroscience, artificial intelligence, and our inherited legal and philosophical traditions. The authors propose a great exorcism: to banish the "Cartesian ghost" of the private inner state—the world of intention, belief, and metaphysical free will—and to ground our understanding of agency, creativity, and responsibility in the public, observable, and corrigible world of "social practices."</p>
            <p>The argument is compelling, meticulously constructed, and draws from a vast and complex field of contemporary thought. And yet, its very coherence reveals a truth far more unsettling than the one it purports to expose. The manuscript is not, as it claims, a revolutionary break from an old paradigm of power. Rather, it is the most lucid and comprehensive articulation of the perfection of that power. It provides the operating manual for a new, and perhaps final, form of governance in which the disciplinary society described by Foucault and the sovereign camp analyzed by Agamben converge into a single, seamless apparatus.</p>
            <p>This is not a condemnation of the book but a testament to its importance. To read it critically is to understand the architecture of the world we are already beginning to inhabit. By examining three crucial moments in the manuscript, we can trace the logic of this new apparatus. We can see how the proposed "solution" to our contemporary crises is, in fact, the mechanism by which human life is captured, administered, and ultimately neutralized. And in this critical reading, we may find not a refutation of the authors' work, but the unexpected wisdom it offers: a clear vision of the challenge that must now be met, and a glimpse of the productive path that lies beyond it.</p>
            <h3>1. The Foundational Gesture: Announcing the Biopolitical Subject</h3>
            <p>The first crucial passage appears at the very beginning, in the abstract to the introduction. It is the book’s foundational gesture, the statement of purpose that sets the entire machinery of its argument in motion:</p>
            <blockquote>"The introduction articulates the convergence of three foundational crises—the human authorship crisis in copyright law, the free will crisis in neuroscience, and the understanding crisis in artificial intelligence—arguing that each exposes the limitations of explaining agency and creativity through private mental states. Drawing on Wittgenstein’s reconceptualization of meaning as inherently public and practice-based, this chapter reframes the challenges faced in law, science, and technology as manifestations of a single philosophical error. It demonstrates how contemporary developments in each field force a reassessment of traditional accounts of authorship, choice, and understanding, revealing a shared theoretical impasse. Rather than treating these crises as isolated, the analysis establishes a unified lens through which the problem of agency must be addressed in the twenty-first century. The chapter foregrounds the necessity of a practice-centered account, arguing that agency, creativity, and responsibility are best understood as emergent from participation in social practices rather than rooted in internal, inaccessible phenomena." (p. 13)</blockquote>
            <p>Here, the authors identify a "single philosophical error": the belief in "internal, inaccessible phenomena." This "inner state" is presented as the source of our confusion, a metaphysical specter that has become inefficient and untenable. The crises in law and science are moments where this old model has broken down. But we must ask: for whom has it become inefficient? The answer is: for power. The private, inner world of the self has always been a zone of opacity, a realm of ambiguity that resists perfect measurement, administration, and control. It is the final, messy refuge of the individual against the totalizing gaze of a system.</p>
            <p>The "practice-centered account" is proposed as the solution. Agency is to be "understood as emergent from participation in social practices." This is not a liberation; it is a strategic relocation. It is the foundational biopolitical gesture described by Agamben. The human being is separated into two parts. On one side, we have the "internal, inaccessible phenomena"—the messy, biological, psychological stuff of what the Greeks called zoe, or bare life. This part is deemed philosophically irrelevant, a ghost to be abandoned. On the other side, we have the "participation in social practices"—the realm of the citizen, the agent, the performer. This is the qualified, political life of bios.</p>
            <p>The entire project of the book is to show how zoe (our determined, biological being as revealed by neuroscience) can be successfully governed by bringing it into the realm of bios (the system of public practices). We are no longer human beings in the full sense; we are biopolitical subjects, creatures whose bare life is included in the political order only through its reduction to a set of manageable performances. The "unified lens" the authors provide is the lens of the administrator, and the subject it sees is one perfectly prepared for governance. This initial passage is the act of drawing the line that separates the part of the human that can be governed (practice) from the part that must be excluded (the inner state), which is the constitutive act of all sovereign power.</p>
            <h3>2. The Apparatus in Action: The Biopolitics of “Value”</h3>
            <p>Having established the biopolitical subject, the manuscript proceeds to show how this new model operates. The second crucial passage, from the analysis of copyright law, reveals the specific techniques of this new form of power. Discussing the landmark case of Bartz v. Anthropic, the authors celebrate the court's reasoning:</p>
            <blockquote>"The analogy made by Judge Alsup between machine learning and human reading has significant resonance with Wittgensteinian theories of language and mind, which treat learning and creativity as emergent from public, rule-governed social practices. The recognition of the court that 'training a model is no different than a person reading a book to learn how to write' encapsulates the move away from metaphysical conceptions of agency to practice-centered, communal frameworks. In this perspective, creative competence is not a function of hidden mental events but of participation in publicly accountable activities that can be scrutinized for purpose, context, and effect." (p. 77)</blockquote>
            <p>This passage is a perfect illustration of Foucault’s concept of a productive, normalizing power. The old, sovereign power of copyright, based on the romantic and "metaphysical" notion of the author’s inner genius, was a clumsy tool. It sought to locate a mysterious, uncontrollable origin point. The new, disciplinary power of copyright is far more sophisticated. It is not interested in origins, but in outcomes. It asks not "what did the author intend?" but "is the activity 'publicly accountable'?" "Can it be scrutinized for 'purpose, context, and effect'?"</p>
            <p>The key term here is "transformative use," which the Bartz decision champions. A work is now judged on the "value" it creates. This is a quintessentially biopolitical standard. "Value" is not an intrinsic quality; it is a measure of a thing's utility and function within a system—the system of the market, of cultural exchange, of information flow. The law no longer protects the mysterious act of creation; it manages the productive circulation of creative commodities.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, the court's analogy—that machine learning and human learning are functionally the same—achieves what Agamben calls a "zone of indistinction." The line between the human and the non-human, the natural and the artificial, becomes blurred and ultimately irrelevant. Both human and machine are now simply "participants" in a "practice," their outputs judged by the same metric of productive value. In this zone, the human is not elevated; they are reduced to the level of the machine—a system that processes inputs and generates outputs. Creativity is no longer a political act of a sovereign subject, but a technical performance within an administrative framework.</p>
            <p>The "accidental wisdom" of copyright law is the wisdom of the apparatus itself, discovering a more efficient way to manage life. It replaces the difficult question of human meaning with the simple, calculable question of systemic function. This is the logic of biopower: it does not repress life, but administers it, optimizes it, and channels it toward productive ends, rendering it all the more governable in the process.</p>
            <h3>3. The Final Enclosure: From Control to Practice</h3>
            <p>The third and final passage reveals the ultimate ambition of this new paradigm of power: the complete dissolution of the individual agent into the machinery of the practice itself. In the chapter on designing ethical AI, the authors make a crucial distinction:</p>
            <blockquote>"The imperative to move from 'meaningful human control' to 'meaningful human practice' finds its most compelling justification in the demand for democratic legitimacy and social sustainability... The future of ethical automated systems thus lies not in perfecting supervisory interfaces, but in fostering the socio-technical conditions for meaningful practice—a project that requires ongoing interdisciplinary inquiry and the critical reinvention of institutional routines." (p. 195)</blockquote>
            <p>The distinction between "control" and "practice" is everything. The notion of "meaningful human control," however flawed, still preserves the image of a human agent who stands, at least partially, outside the system they are controlling. The "human in the loop" is still a sovereign, an overseer who can, in theory, intervene and assert their will.</p>
            <p>The move to "meaningful human practice" eliminates this final refuge. A "practice" is a system of rules and norms that precedes any individual participant. To participate in a practice is to be defined by it, to have one's agency constituted by its rules. The human is no longer the controller of the system; they are a component within it. Their "meaningfulness" is not their own; it is granted to them by their successful performance within the "socio-technical conditions."</p>
            <p>This is the perfection of Foucault’s disciplinary subject—the self-regulating, self-governing individual who has so thoroughly internalized the norms of the practice that external control becomes unnecessary. It is also the realization of Agamben's ultimate camp. In a world defined by "meaningful human practice," there is no "outside." The practice is the law of the camp, and our participation is the condition of our existence within it. The call for "transparency," which echoes throughout the manuscript, becomes the demand for the total visibility of the inmate, whose every performance is open to scrutiny and correction.</p>
            <p>The project of "reinventing institutional routines" is the project of building a more perfect camp—a self-sustaining, adaptive system of administration that requires no external sovereign because the sovereign has become the system itself. We are promised "democratic legitimacy," but it is the democracy of the well-run prison, where the inmates are invited to participate in the ongoing refinement of their own confinement.</p>
            <h3>Conclusion: Toward an Inoperative Life</h3>
            <p><em>Mind, Machine, and Will</em> is an indispensable book precisely because it provides such a clear and unapologetic blueprint for the form of power that will define our future. It shows us a world where the administration of life has become the ultimate horizon of our politics, ethics, and law. The authors have done us the great service of naming the apparatus, describing its mechanisms, and celebrating its efficiency.</p>
            <p>What, then, is the productive path forward? It cannot be a retreat to the Cartesian ghost, a nostalgic defense of the sovereign inner self. That battle has been lost, and the authors are right to say that the ghost was an illusion all along. The path forward must begin with the recognition that the "practice-based" world the authors describe is not a solution, but the problem itself.</p>
            <p>The task is not to build more "ethical," "transparent," and "participatory" practices. The task is to discover and cultivate what Agamben might call a "form-of-life"—a way of being and acting that cannot be resolved into the biopolitical distinction between bare life (zoe) and political function (bios). The challenge is to think of a practice that is not productive, a form of communication that is not about utility, and a mode of being together that is not a form of administration. This is the search for the inoperative.</p>
            <p>To render the apparatus inoperative does not mean to destroy it, but to suspend its function, to deactivate its mechanisms of capture. In copyright, this might mean an art that refuses the logic of "transformative value" and insists on its own gratuitous, useless, and beautiful existence. In law, it might mean a justice that refuses the choice between retribution and rehabilitation, and instead seeks a form of collective life where the very categories of "crime" and "competence" are put into question. In our relationship with technology, it might mean an engagement that is not about "meaningful practice" but about play, about the invention of new uses for the machine that defy the intentions of its designers and the logic of its programming.</p>
            <p>The unexpected wisdom of <em>Mind, Machine, and Will</em> is that it forces us to confront this choice. We can accept its vision and become willing participants in the construction of a perfectly administered world. Or we can take its lucid analysis as a warning, as a call to begin the difficult work of imagining a politics, an ethics, and a form of life that lies beyond the reach of the apparatus. This is the truly revolutionary task that awaits us in the determined age.</p>
