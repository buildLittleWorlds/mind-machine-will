            <h2>Science Fiction is EXPOSING Scams and AI Dystopia (w/ Cory Doctorow)</h2>
            <p class="meta">Posted by Cory Doctorow | July 29, 2025</p>
            <p><em>(This is an imaginative reconstruction of a blog post based on the YouTube video "Science Fiction is EXPOSING Scams and AI Dystopia (w/ Cory Doctorow)" from the Bad Faith channel, which premiered on June 2, 2025, and has 14,416 views. The original video can be found at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlrKlp_Iiko&t=2s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlrKlp_Iiko&t=2s</a>.)</em></p>
            <p>Alright, let's get into this.</p>
            <p>I’ve got a manuscript here, <em>Mind, Machine, and Will</em>, that’s so smart it’s in danger of disappearing up its own tailpipe. The authors, Daniel Plate and James Hutson, have done their homework. They've read their Wittgenstein, they've read their Sapolsky, they've followed the copyright cases. They’ve connected the dots and seen a pattern: the old ghost-in-the-machine story is on its last legs.</p>
            <p>Across law, neuroscience, and AI, they argue, we're finally ditching the fantasy of the sovereign, inner self—the little homunculus in our skulls pulling the levers of intention—and replacing it with a model of "public practice." Meaning isn't some private mental magic; it's something we do together, out in the open. Originality in copyright isn't a spark from a lone genius; it's about transformative use. Free will isn't real; we're just complex machines shaped by a million inputs. An AI doesn't "think"; it just participates, convincingly, in a language game.</p>
            <p>So far, so good. I’m with them. This is the correct diagnosis. The idea that Big Tech has a mind control ray they use to sell your nephew a fidget spinner is, as I've said, a fantasy that mostly helps them sell ads. Plate and Hutson correctly see that the action isn't in the spooky, inaccessible black box of consciousness, human or otherwise.</p>
            <p>But here’s where the whole enterprise gets stuck in first gear. This book describes a beautiful, clean, philosophical revolution, a kind of intellectual changing of the guard where better ideas gracefully displace worse ones. It's a story about paradigms shifting. What’s missing is the street fight. What's missing is the money. What's missing is the raw, brutal application of power that actually decides which "practices" become the norm and who gets screwed in the process.</p>
            <p>The authors talk about the "accidental wisdom" of copyright law's evolution. Accidental wisdom? Let me tell you a story. Mark Zuckerberg didn't beat MySpace because he had a better philosophy of social practice. He beat MySpace by giving users a bot that scraped their messages so they could transition without losing their friends—a classic case of adversarial interoperability. Then, once he was on top, he spent the next decade and billions of dollars weaponizing contract law, the DMCA, and every other legal club he could find to make damn sure no one could ever do the same to him. When a real competitor, Instagram, emerged anyway, he just bought it, putting the premeditated murder of competition in writing for his CFO, and the Obama administration just waved it through.</p>
            <p>That’s not an "evolution of doctrine." That's regulatory capture. That's monopoly power.</p>
            <p>The book discusses the Bartz v. Anthropic case as a breakthrough where the law recognizes "transformative use." This is presented as a sophisticated pivot to valuing "value creation over creative intention." That’s one way to put it. Here's another: it’s a high-stakes brawl over whether a handful of titanic firms get to launder the entire creative output of humanity through a statistical blender and sell it back to us forever, without paying the people who did the work. They call it "learning"; creators call it industrial-scale plagiarism. To frame this as a gentle turn toward a more enlightened, Wittgensteinian legal standard is to mistake the sound of a knife fight for a philosophical debate.</p>
            <p>The authors are right that what matters is the practice, but they forget to ask who owns the stadium where the practice is held. Who wrote the rules? Who pays the refs?</p>
            <p>And this brings us to their take on AI. They see Large Language Models as "Language Game Participants." This is a dangerously clean metaphor. An AI isn't a new player who just showed up at the weekly poker game. It's a tool, owned by a monopolist, designed to concentrate wealth and power. It's a machine for automating the process of "enshittification"—of degrading services to extract every last crumb of value for shareholders. Calling it a "participant" grants it a kind of agency it doesn't have and obscures the very human, very greedy agency of the people who own it.</p>
            <p>An LLM isn't "participating" in a conversation any more than a pickup artist who spams a million women with the same negging line is "participating" in a romance. He’s not a master of seduction; he’s a Texas marksman, firing a million shots and then drawing a target around the one that hit something. It's a numbers game, a con. And that's what AI is: a very sophisticated, very expensive con for convincing people that a stochastic parrot has a soul, right before it takes their job and sells them a subscription to the chatbot that replaced them.</p>
            <p><em>Mind, Machine, and Will</em> offers a brilliant framework for understanding why the old stories about mind and self are failing. But it's a book about a war written from 30,000 feet. Down on the ground, this isn't a neat transition from one conceptual scheme to another. It's a messy, brutal struggle over who gets to write the Terms of Service for the 21st century. The transformation isn't being driven by philosophical insight; it's being driven by capital.</p>
            <p>What do we gain by abandoning inner states? The authors argue we gain transparent, inclusive, and democratic institutions. What I see us getting, unless we fight back, is a world where monopolies are even less accountable, because they've successfully laundered their scams through the neutralizing language of "practice," "systems," and "distributed agency."</p>
            <p>This book is a vital piece of the puzzle, an excellent map of the intellectual territory. But it’s not a battle plan. And right now, a battle plan is what we desperately need. The real revolution isn't in our heads; it's in breaking up the companies that have a boot on our necks.</p>
