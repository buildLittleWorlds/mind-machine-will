            <h2>Advisory Opinions: Episode 5</h2>
            <p class="meta">By David French and Sarah Isgur | July 31, 2025</p>
            
            <p>(Intro Music with an academic, slightly classical feel fades in and then fades out)</p>

            <p><strong>Sarah Isgur:</strong> Welcome back to Advisory Opinions. I’m Sarah Isgur, and this is the fifth and final episode of our series on the manuscript <em>Mind, Machine, and Will</em>. I’m here, as always, with David French.</p>

            <p><strong>David French:</strong> It has been quite a journey, Sarah. From AI-authored art to neuroscientific challenges to free will, we’ve been wrestling with some of the most foundational questions in law and philosophy.</p>

            <p><strong>Sarah Isgur:</strong> We really have. And today, we’re bringing it all home. The book argues that the "crises" in copyright, criminal law, and AI liability aren't isolated problems. It claims they are all symptoms of a much deeper philosophical shift—the slow-motion collapse of a legal system built on the idea of knowing an individual’s "inner mental state." In this final episode, we’re going to look at the manuscript’s ultimate claim: that this shift is now forcing a radical reinterpretation of the Constitution itself. David, you get to start us off with the grand, sweeping quote that frames this final discussion.</p>

            <p><strong>David French:</strong> It is a grand one. The abstract for Chapter 11 says the book:</p>

            <p><em>(Reading from script)</em> “...advances a practice-based, post-Cartesian jurisprudence—one that grounds legal standing, protection, and process in public, corrigible practices and institutional participation.”</p>

            <p><strong>David French:</strong> A "post-Cartesian jurisprudence." For our listeners, René Descartes is the philosopher famous for "I think, therefore I am"—the idea that the self, the mind, the "inner state," is the foundation of all knowledge. So, a "post-Cartesian" jurisprudence is one that moves past the individual mind as its anchor. It’s a legal system for a world "living after the Cartesian ghost," as the book puts it. This isn't just about changing a few statutes, Sarah. This is about changing the very source code of our legal order.</p>

            <p><strong>Sarah Isgur:</strong> And that’s a terrifying prospect. Our entire constitutional tradition is built on the idea of individual rights, individual responsibility, and individual dignity. A "post-Cartesian" framework that grounds everything in "collective practices" sounds dangerously close to a framework that can swallow the individual whole. But let’s make this concrete. The most obvious place this plays out is in equal protection law.</p>

            <p><em>(Reading from script)</em> “This libertarian framework has been criticized for failing to address the systemic and structural forms of inequality that persist in the absence of explicit, individualized intent... the practice-based turn challenges courts and lawmakers to interrogate patterns, practices, and institutional routines that generate disparate impacts...”</p>

            <p><strong>Sarah Isgur:</strong> This is a perfect example of the stakes. For the last 50 years, since <em>Washington v. Davis</em>, the Supreme Court has said that to prove a violation of the Equal Protection Clause, you have to prove that the government had a racially discriminatory <em>purpose</em>. You have to prove the "inner state" of animus. The authors of this book, and many legal scholars on the left, argue this is an impossible standard that allows systemic racism to flourish behind a mask of facial neutrality. They want to replace an intent-based standard with an effects-based standard, focusing on "disparate impacts." David, this isn’t just a small tweak. This would be the single biggest change in constitutional law in half a century.</p>

            <p><strong>David French:</strong> It would be monumental. And what's fascinating is how the manuscript arrives at this conclusion. It's not through a political or critical race theory argument. It's presented as the logical and philosophically necessary endpoint of this entire shift away from "inner states." If you accept that we can't truly know intent, then an intent-based legal standard is incoherent. You *must*, as a matter of philosophical consistency, turn to what you can observe: the practice and its effects. It’s a radical conclusion arrived at through a seemingly conservative, process-based methodology.</p>

            <p><strong>Sarah Isgur:</strong> But it is still a radical conclusion! It would invalidate countless laws and government practices that are neutral on their face but have a disparate impact on a particular group. Think of everything from standardized testing to zoning laws to hiring criteria for police officers. The potential for judicial social engineering is almost limitless. You’re taking power away from democratically elected legislatures and giving it to judges to redesign society based on statistical outcomes. I see this as profoundly anti-democratic.</p>
            
            <p><strong>David French:</strong> And the book would argue it is profoundly *pro*-democratic, because it makes institutions accountable for the real-world consequences of their actions, not just their stated intentions. It forces a public justification of a practice that produces unequal outcomes. But this same logic applies to another core constitutional principle: due process.</p>

            <p>(Transition Music)</p>

            <p><strong>David French:</strong> Just as equal protection has been tied to intent, due process has often been tied to the "good faith" of the government actor. As long as the official wasn't acting with malice, the process was often deemed sufficient. The book argues this is another "inner state" fallacy.</p>

            <p><em>(Reading from script)</em> “The true core of due process lies not in the assurance of benevolent intentions but in the public visibility, contestability, and accountability of legal and administrative procedures.”</p>
            
            <p><strong>David French:</strong> This connects directly to our discussion last week about AI liability. True due process, in this view, has nothing to do with the internal motivations of the decision-maker, whether it’s a human or an algorithm. It has everything to do with the *procedure* itself. Was there notice? Was there a hearing? Was there an opportunity to appeal? Were the standards public and the process transparent? This is a vision of due process that is robust enough to handle the challenges of a modern administrative state and an automated world.</p>

            <p><strong>Sarah Isgur:</strong> I don't disagree with any of that as a matter of good government. Of course, we want transparent and accountable procedures. But I worry that by stripping out the element of "bad faith" or "animus," we lose the ability to address the most egregious forms of government abuse. There’s a difference between a good-faith mistake made within a flawed system and a malicious act by a government official who is intentionally trying to harm someone. This framework seems to blur that line. It treats every failure as a procedural hiccup, rather than a moral wrong. It takes the *justice* out of procedural justice.</p>

            <p><strong>David French:</strong> I’d argue it makes it *more* just by making it more objective. It’s incredibly difficult to prove the subjective malice of a government official. It is much easier, and ultimately more effective, to prove that the process they used was fundamentally unfair, regardless of their private motivations. It grounds the right in an observable reality, not in a speculative mind-reading exercise. It empowers the citizen by focusing on the system, which can be reformed, rather than on the heart of the bureaucrat, which cannot.</p>

            <p><strong>Sarah Isgur:</strong> But at what cost? We’re systematically draining the moral and philosophical content out of our most cherished legal principles and replacing it with a cold, amoral proceduralism. This feels like the ultimate victory of the administrative state over the spirit of the law. But this brings us to the book's grand conclusion, what it calls the "unexpected unity."</p>

            <p>(Transition Music)</p>

            <p><strong>Sarah Isgur:</strong> So, we’ve come to the end of the road. The authors have argued that the same fundamental shift—from inner states to public practices—is happening everywhere. In copyright, in criminal law, in AI liability, and now in constitutional law. They call this the "unexpected unity."</p>

            <p><em>(Reading from script)</em> “Across domains as disparate as copyright doctrine, neuroscience, and artificial intelligence, the trajectory is unmistakable: a decisive shift from theories rooted in the opacity of inner mental states to frameworks grounded in the public, observable, and corrigible practices of communities.”</p>
            
            <p><strong>Sarah Isgur:</strong> This is the big reveal. The book claims this isn't just a collection of unrelated legal problems; it's a single, massive, epochal transformation. David, after going through this whole manuscript, what do you think? Are you a convert? Do you believe we are living through the dawn of a "post-Cartesian" age?</p>

            <p><strong>David French:</strong> (Pauses) I am deeply compelled by the diagnosis. I think the book is absolutely brilliant in identifying the inherent instability of a legal system based on unverifiable "inner states." It has exposed a fundamental tension that has always existed but has now been brought to a crisis point by modern technology and science. I am also deeply aligned with its proposed alternative in many areas. The move toward proceduralism, transparency, and institutional accountability is a move toward a more robust and honest rule of law. It aligns with the best of the classical liberal tradition.</p>

            <p><strong>Sarah Isgur:</strong> But? I hear a 'but' coming.</p>

            <p><strong>David French:</strong> But... I cannot follow it all the way down the road. I cannot let go of the concept of the individual moral agent. As a person of faith, I believe there is more to a human being than the sum of their causal inputs. There is a soul, a conscience, an "inner state" that matters profoundly. And as a constitutionalist, I believe our system of rights is ultimately designed to protect that inner spark of dignity and freedom. The book’s framework, for all its intellectual power, risks creating a system that is procedurally perfect but morally empty. It’s a world without heroes or villains, just functioning and malfunctioning systems. I am not ready to live in that world.</p>

            <p><strong>Sarah Isgur:</strong> And that’s where I land as well, though I come at it from a different direction. For me, this isn’t a theological problem; it’s an institutional one. A system that abandons the language of individual responsibility, blame, and desert is a system that will ultimately lose its legitimacy in the eyes of the people it governs. The law cannot be completely divorced from our deepest moral intuitions. The book dismisses these as "folk psychology," but they are the very intuitions that give the law its power and its meaning. You can’t have a government of the people if that government speaks a language that the people no longer recognize as justice. It becomes an alienating, technocratic force.</p>

            <p><strong>David French:</strong> So, in the end, we are both fellow travelers with the book up to a point, but we both get off the train before it reaches its final destination.</p>

            <p><strong>Sarah Isgur:</strong> I think that's right. And it's a fascinating place to end. The book's final call to action is a powerful one, and I want to read it to close out our series.</p>
            
            <p><em>(Reading from script)</em> “The final call to action, then, is both scholarly and civic: to move beyond defensive postures and metaphysical nostalgia, and to take up the ongoing task of building, contesting, and renewing the social, legal, and technological practices through which agency, meaning, and justice are enacted.”</p>
            
            <p><strong>Sarah Isgur:</strong> I can’t disagree with that as an aspiration. It’s a call to take the challenges of our time seriously. It’s a call to engage in the hard work of building and maintaining just institutions. But for me, that work must include a robust defense of the individual. That’s the "practice" I am committed to renewing.</p>

            <p><strong>David French:</strong> Amen to that. It’s a recognition that these are not settled questions. This is the great debate of our time, and the law will be the primary arena where it plays out. This manuscript has provided an incredible, if challenging, roadmap to that debate.</p>

            <p><strong>Sarah Isgur:</strong> It certainly has. It’s been a fascinating journey, David. Thank you for taking it with me. And thank you to our listeners for sticking with us through some very deep philosophical weeds. We’ll be back to our regularly scheduled programming of cert grants and circuit splits next week.</p>
