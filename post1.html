            <h2>Are We All Just Algorithms? A Writer's Takedown of 'Mind, Machine, and Will'</h2>
            <p class="meta">Posted by Lindy Jung | July 28, 2025</p>
            <p><em>(This is an imaginative reconstruction of a blog post that might be written by YouTuber Lynn D. Jung, based on her video titled "you don’t know the full truth about generative ai ‘writing.’" which garnered 14,143 views on July 26, 2025. The original video can be found at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVo2dQevVBg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVo2dQevVBg</a>.)</em></p>
            <p>Hi. Today we're going to talk a bit about generative AI's rise in writing and publishing. Okay, folks. Settle in, grab your beverage of choice (mine is a rapidly cooling tea, as usual), because we need to talk.</p>
            <p>I’ve just clawed my way through a book that feels less like a piece of scholarship and more like an existential threat bound in paperback. It’s called <em>Mind, Machine, and Will: Determinism, Responsibility, and Agency in the Age of AI</em>, and it’s written by two incredibly smart academics, Professors Daniel Plate and James Hutson. And when I say smart, I mean it. This book is a dense, rigorously argued, philosophical sledgehammer. It synthesizes neuroscience, copyright law, analytic philosophy, and the latest AI developments into a single, unified theory. It’s the kind of book you read with a highlighter in one hand and a bottle of aspirin in the other.</p>
            <p>And I believe every writer, artist, and creator needs to know about it, because the tidy, intellectual world it builds is one where our work, our passion, and our very souls are rendered obsolete.</p>
            <h3>The Wittgensteinian Guillotine and the Death of the Author (For Real This Time)</h3>
            <p>The primary weapon Plate and Hutson wield is the philosophy of Ludwig Wittgenstein. For those who haven’t spent time in the philosophy corner of a university library, the key takeaway they use is Wittgenstein’s "private language argument." The idea is that a word can’t have meaning just for one person. Meaning is inherently public. You know what a "chair" is because we all participate in a shared "language game" where we agree on how to use the word "chair." Without that public agreement, the sounds coming out of your mouth are just noise.</p>
            <p>Plate and Hutson take this idea and apply it to everything. Your intention to write a tragic love story? Irrelevant until it is performed on the page and recognized as a tragic love story by the community (readers, publishers, etc.). The 15 years I spent wrestling with my first novel, the one that grew with me from childhood to adulthood and taught me everything I know about writing? They’d argue the value wasn't in my private struggle or personal growth, but only in the parts of that process that manifested as a publicly recognizable "competence."</p>
            <p>On the surface, it’s a seductively logical argument. Of course a book needs a reader to complete the circuit of meaning. But their conclusion is radical and, I think, deeply wrong. They essentially argue that the internal, subjective experience of creation is just a byproduct—a puff of smoke—while the real action is the social transaction.</p>
            <h3>The Determinist Cage: Sapolsky and the Soulless Parallel</h3>
            <p>If Wittgenstein is their philosophical guillotine, then neuroscientist Robert Sapolsky is the man who builds the cage. Plate and Hutson lean heavily on Sapolsky’s work on "hard determinism"—the theory that free will is an illusion. Every choice you make, every word you write, is the inescapable result of a causal chain stretching back through your genetics, your environment, your childhood, the breakfast you ate this morning. You aren’t the author of your actions; you’re the vehicle through which countless prior causes express themselves.</p>
            <p>Again, it’s a powerful scientific argument. But Plate and Hutson use it to draw a devastating parallel. If humans are just complex, determined biological systems, and a large language model is a complex, determined silicon system, what’s the fundamental difference? They write about the "parallel structure of human and machine 'decisions'." In their view, my lived experience—the joy, the grief, the political anger that fuels my sci-fi worlds—is just my unique "training data." It’s different in kind, perhaps, from the terabytes of text scraped from the internet to train an AI, but it’s not metaphysically special.</p>
            <h3>A World Without Ghosts: The Corporate Dream</h3>
            <p>So what’s the endgame here? Why build this elaborate philosophical system to exorcise the ghosts from our machines and our minds? The answer becomes clear when they turn to practical matters like copyright law.</p>
            <p>They see the evolution of copyright away from "authorial intent" and toward concepts like "transformative use" as a positive development. In their post-Cartesian world, a work's value isn't tied to the genius of its creator, but to its function in the public square. A court shouldn’t care what was in the author's heart; it should only care about the observable output and its effect on the community.</p>
            <h3>Conclusion: Our Ghosts Are Worth Fighting For</h3>
            <p>I’ll give Plate and Hutson this: they are consistent. Their logic is a sealed room. If you accept their premise—that the inner world is a metaphysical illusion—then the rest of their conclusions follow with a terrifying and inescapable certainty.</p>
            <p>But I refuse to accept the premise.</p>
            <p><em>Mind, Machine, and Will</em> is a brilliant and important book, but not for the reasons its authors think. It’s important because it shows us the intellectual endpoint of a purely mechanistic, materialistic view of creativity. It is a warning. It is the logical conclusion of what happens when we let our tools define our humanity, rather than the other way around.</p>
            <p>The human process—the passion, the struggle, the years of unseen effort, the life experience that bleeds onto the page—is not a bug in the system. It is not a ghost to be exorcised. It is the entire point. It is the feature that makes art matter. It is the source of the magic.</p>
            <p>Plate and Hutson have built a magnificent, intricate, and perfectly hollow clock. They can tell you the time, but they can never explain why it’s worth watching the sun rise.</p>
            <p>As for me, I’ll keep my ghosts. They’re where the stories come from.</p>
