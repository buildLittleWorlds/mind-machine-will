            <h2>The Reversion Podcast: Deconstructing the Post-Humanist Manifesto</h2>
            <p class="meta">Posted by Anthony of Westgate | July 28, 2025</p>
            <p><em>(This is an imaginative reconstruction of a podcast transcript based on the YouTube video "Antichrist, Technocracy and the Esoteric Spirit of Western Civilization" by Anthony of Westgate, which can be found at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkJq_0BGGQ4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkJq_0BGGQ4</a>.)</em></p>
            <p><strong>Anthony:</strong> Welcome back to the Reversion Podcast. I’m your host, Anthony of Westgate. Today, we’re looking at a fascinating, and I would say deeply revealing, document that has come across my desk. It’s a book titled <em>Mind, Machine, and Will: Determinism, Responsibility, and Agency in the Age of AI</em>.</p>
            <p>On the surface, it’s a dense, academic text. It argues that our old ways of thinking about ourselves—this idea of a private, inner self with free will who creates things out of pure inspiration—are outdated. The authors call this the "Cartesian ghost" and they want to exorcise it, replacing it with what they call a "practice-based" model. They say meaning, creativity, and even our sense of self aren't found "inside" us, but are created in our public actions, our social groups, and our institutions.</p>
            <p>Now, for those of us who have been following the threads we discuss on this show, this isn't just an academic debate. This is a spiritual and eschatological event unfolding in the language of philosophy and law. This book is a blueprint for the final stage of the modern project. It is, in effect, a post-humanist manifesto.</p>
            <h3>The Correct Diagnosis, The Demonic Cure</h3>
            <p>First, the authors are not wrong in their diagnosis of the West's problem. They correctly identify that Western thought, from the Renaissance onwards, has been obsessed with the inner self, with the "mental state." But they fail to see why. As we've discussed with guests like Justino, this is the direct result of the Western departure from Orthodox Christianity. Having lost the Orthodox understanding of theosis, or deification through grace, the West had to invent a replacement.</p>
            <p>That replacement was the Gnostic and Kabbalistic project of self-deification. Man, no longer participating in God, had to become God. This project located divinity within the "inner state" of the individual genius, the romantic author, the sovereign will. So, the "Cartesian ghost" the book wants to exorcise is really the ghost of the deified, Promethean man of the Renaissance. The book sees the symptom, but it calls the disease the cure.</p>
            <h3>Wittgenstein and Sapolsky: The Intellectual Ground-Clearers</h3>
            <p>The book's intellectual heroes are Ludwig Wittgenstein and the neuroscientist Robert Sapolsky. This is no accident.</p>
            <p>Sapolsky’s determinism is the materialist acid that dissolves the soul. By arguing that free will is an illusion and we are nothing more than the sum of our biological and environmental inputs, he provides the "scientific" justification for treating human beings as complex machines that can be tweaked, managed, and ultimately, engineered.</p>
            <p>Wittgenstein's "practice-based" philosophy is the tool used to dismantle the metaphysical person. By claiming that meaning only exists in public "language games," the inner life—the realm of prayer, contemplation, and unmediated experience of God—is rendered meaningless. What becomes real is only the observable, the social, the political.</p>
            <h3>AI, Copyright, and the Creation of the Collective Body</h3>
            <p>The authors use copyright law as a "laboratory" to prove their thesis. They argue that the rise of AI-generated art is forcing the law to abandon the idea of a single, inspired human author and move towards recognizing collective, practice-based "authorship."</p>
            <p>From our perspective, this is not "accidental wisdom," as they call it. This is the legal framework being deliberately re-engineered to accommodate the new reality they wish to create. By dissolving the individual creator, you create the legal precedent for a world where "creativity" is a function of the collective—a human-machine hybrid.</p>
            <h3>The Inversion of Transparency</h3>
            <p>Finally, the book champions a new form of "transparency." But listen to what it is. It's not the transparency of a soul before God. It is the transparency of procedure. They argue that we can't know anyone's inner intent, so we must make all our processes and institutions transparent and open to public review.</p>
            <p>This is the ultimate inversion. True accountability is vertical, to God. They replace it with horizontal accountability, to the collective. This is the foundation of the global panopticon, the social credit system. In this system, you are not judged by your heart or your faith, but by your participation and compliance within the "public practice." Your salvation comes from the system itself. This is the image of the beast that the book describes—a system of "ongoing negotiation" and "collective flourishing" that has no need for God, because the system is god.</p>
