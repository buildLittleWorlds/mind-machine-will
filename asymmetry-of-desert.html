            <h2>The Asymmetry of Desert: A Practice-Based Resolution to the Contradiction of Blame and Praise</h2>
            
            <h3>Part I: Deconstructing the Two Poles of the Contradiction</h3>

            <h4>Section 1: The Determined Criminal: Sapolsky's Challenge and Justice Without Desert</h4>
            <p>The contemporary university classroom often serves as a crucible for competing ethical intuitions. One of the most prevalent is a compassionate, scientifically-informed view of criminal behavior, which holds that individuals who commit crimes are often products of forces beyond their control and should therefore be rehabilitated rather than retributively punished. This perspective, while laudable in its empathy, rests on a profound philosophical claim about the nature of human agency—a claim that, if applied consistently, has radical implications for all domains of human achievement. This section will build the strongest possible case for this deterministic view of the criminal, drawing primarily on the neuroscientific arguments of Robert Sapolsky, to establish the first pole of the contradiction that this report seeks to resolve. It will detail the scientific case against libertarian free will and explore its necessary consequence: a system of justice without desert.</p>

            <h5>1.1 The Neuroscientific Case Against Libertarian Free Will</h5>
            <p>The foundation of the modern argument against free will is a deterministic model of human action, powerfully articulated by neuroscientist Robert Sapolsky. This model posits that every human behavior is the result of a seamless and unbroken causal chain, leaving no room for a metaphysical self that stands outside of biology and environment to make an uncaused choice. Sapolsky’s central thesis is that "we are nothing more or less than the cumulative biological and environmental luck, over which we had no control, that has brought us to any moment". To prove the existence of free will, one would need to demonstrate that a neuron could fire or a decision could be made without any preceding causal influence—a "causeless cause" that is independent of the sum of its biological and environmental past. From a scientific perspective, such an event is not just unproven; it is conceptually incoherent, a piece of "magic" shoehorned into the gaps of our understanding.</p>
            <p>This deterministic framework is often visualized with the metaphor of "turtles all the way down," signifying that there is no final, self-supporting turtle at the bottom of the causal stack; there are only antecedent causes stretching back in time. The analysis of any given action reveals a cascade of determining factors operating on different timescales. In the seconds before a behavior, neurobiological events are paramount: the sensory stimuli present in the environment (such as a particular smell), ambient hormone levels, and the current state of neural networks all shape the brain's response. In the hours and days prior, factors like sleep, stress, and diet alter brain chemistry and function. Expanding the timeline further reveals the profound impact of adolescent development, childhood experiences, and even the fetal environment, where maternal stress can permanently alter the architecture of the developing brain. The causal chain extends further back to an individual's genetic inheritance and the deep evolutionary history that shaped the very structure of the human brain. Each layer of this complex web adds another constraint, another determining influence, until the space for an independent, freely willing self disappears entirely.</p>
            <p>This scientific model directly challenges not only libertarian views of free will but also the more moderate position of compatibilism. Compatibilists argue that free will can coexist with determinism, suggesting that an action is "free" if an agent acts on their own desires and reasons, without external coercion. The manuscript <em>Mind, Machine, and Will</em> argues that this is a philosophically unstable compromise, as it "misses the point about inner states". The neuroscientific and philosophical critique reveals that the desires, intentions, and reasons upon which the compatibilist relies are themselves the products of the same deterministic causal chain. If one's values and preferences are shaped by genetics, upbringing, and environment, then acting in accordance with them is not an expression of freedom but another manifestation of one's causal history. The compatibilist mistake, therefore, is to preserve a "ghost" of inner agency, a privileged mental space that is somehow exempt from the deterministic forces that shape every other aspect of our being.</p>

            <h5>1.2 Justice Without Desert: The Ethical Implications of Determinism</h5>
            <p>Accepting the comprehensive determinism advanced by Sapolsky necessitates a radical reimagining of the criminal justice system. If individuals are not the ultimate authors of their actions, then the entire edifice of retributive justice—which is predicated on the idea that people deserve blame and punishment for their wrongdoing—collapses. As Sapolsky argues, in a world without free will, concepts of praise, blame, reward, and punishment "make no sense whatsoever as virtues". The logical and moral consequence of determinism is the profound "erosion of blame" as a coherent concept. Hating a person for a crime they were determined to commit becomes as irrational as "hating the sky for storming" or "hating the earth when it quakes". The notion of "just deserts" is rendered scientifically and ethically indefensible; one can no more "deserve" punishment for having faulty neural wiring than for having a congenital illness.</p>
            <p>This philosophical conclusion is not merely an abstract thought experiment; it reflects a tangible, albeit gradual, paradigm shift within the legal system itself. The burgeoning field of "neurolaw" demonstrates how neuroscientific evidence is already being used in courtrooms to mitigate culpability and challenge traditional notions of responsibility. Evidence of brain tumors, traumatic brain injuries, genetic predispositions, or developmental abnormalities is increasingly introduced, particularly during sentencing, to argue that an offender's capacity for self-control was compromised. This practical application of neuroscience in legal settings shows that the students' intuition is not just an abstract ethical stance but a reflection of a real-world evolution in legal practice, where the hard lines of blame are softening under the weight of scientific evidence.</p>
            <p>The necessary alternative to a retributive system is what is often termed a "public health" or "quarantine" model of justice. This forward-looking approach dispenses with moral condemnation and focuses instead on pragmatic goals: preventing future harm, rehabilitating individuals where possible, and incapacitating those who remain a danger to society. In this model, a dangerous criminal is treated much like a person with a contagious disease or a broken car: the goal is not to punish them for their condition but to manage the risk they pose to the public. Interventions are tailored to the specific causes of the behavior—be it addiction, mental illness, or lack of impulse control—with the aim of restoring the individual to safe functioning within the community. For those who cannot be rehabilitated, incapacitation is justified not as deserved punishment, but as a necessary public safety measure, akin to quarantining a patient with an incurable, infectious disease. This framework fully articulates the compassionate, deterministic view of criminal justice that many students find compelling, providing a coherent and scientifically grounded basis for a justice system without desert.</p>
            
            <h4>Section 2: The Romantic Artist: Merit, Moral Luck, and the Social Construction of Genius</h4>
            <p>In stark contrast to the deterministic and compassionate view applied to criminals, the common perspective on artists is one of meritocratic individualism. Artists, in this view, are seen as exceptional agents who, through talent, hard work, and unique vision, create works of value and therefore deserve praise, recognition, and reward. This section will deconstruct this second, libertarian pole of the contradiction. It will argue that the notion of the artist as a self-creating genius is a "philosophical error" rooted in an outdated Romantic ideology. By introducing the concept of "moral luck" and examining the social and economic determinants of success, this analysis will demonstrate that the artist's achievement is just as much a product of a deterministic causal chain as the criminal's transgression, thereby undermining the very foundation of praise and merit.</p>

            <h5>2.1 Deconstructing the "Romantic Author": A Philosophical Error</h5>
            <p>The belief in the artist as a unique creator deserving of special reward finds its legal codification in the "human authorship requirement" of copyright law. The manuscript <em>Mind, Machine, and Will</em> compellingly argues that this legal doctrine is, at its core, a "philosophical error". This error stems from the "Romantic theory of authorship," an ideology that emerged in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries and which locates the source of a work's value in the private, inaccessible "inner states" of its creator: their unique feelings, intentions, imagination, and genius. This model posits the author as an originator, a font of creativity whose work is a direct expression of their inner self.</p>
            <p>This Romantic ideal has been systematically dismantled by twentieth-century literary and cultural theory. Roland Barthes, in his seminal essay "The Death of the Author," argues that the author is not a godlike creator but merely a "scriptor" who does not originate meaning but rather channels a vast "tissue of quotations" drawn from innumerable centers of culture. For Barthes, to assign an author and their biography as the ultimate explanation of a text is "to impose a limit on that text"; its true unity lies not in its origin (the author) but in its destination (the reader). Michel Foucault extends this critique with his concept of the "author function". Foucault argues that the "author" is not a real person but a social and institutional construct that serves to classify, organize, and regulate discourses within a society. The author's name functions as a label that groups texts, confers authority, and makes someone legally and socially responsible for a body of work. Together, these post-structuralist critiques provide a powerful theoretical apparatus for moving beyond the simplistic notion of the artist as a solitary genius, revealing them instead as a node within a complex web of cultural, linguistic, and institutional forces.</p>

            <h5>2.2 The Role of Luck in Artistic Achievement: An Introduction to Moral Luck</h5>
            <p>The most potent philosophical tool for applying deterministic logic to the artist is the concept of "moral luck," developed by philosophers Bernard Williams and Thomas Nagel. Moral luck describes situations where an agent is correctly treated as an object of moral judgment, despite the fact that a significant aspect of what they are assessed for depends on factors beyond their control. This directly challenges the common intuition that we should only be held responsible for what we can control. By examining artistic achievement through this lens, it becomes clear that what we call "merit" is profoundly shaped by luck. Nagel identifies four kinds of luck that are directly applicable to the artist:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Constitutive Luck:</strong> This is the luck of one's innate constitution—the talents, temperament, and capacities one is born with. An artist's "genius" or natural talent is not something they created or earned; it is a product of the genetic and developmental lottery. To praise an artist for their innate gifts is to praise them for their good fortune.</li>
                <li><strong>Circumstantial Luck:</strong> This is the luck of the circumstances one finds oneself in. An artist's success often depends on being born into a family that could afford art lessons, living in a cultural center like Paris or New York, encountering the right mentors, or emerging at a historical moment when their particular style is in vogue. These are all factors entirely beyond their control.</li>
                <li><strong>Causal Luck:</strong> This refers to the broader problem of determinism—that one's will, character, and actions are the product of an antecedent chain of causes. The artist's discipline, their drive to create, and the very content of their imagination are shaped by the same web of biological and environmental forces that shape the criminal.</li>
                <li><strong>Resultant Luck:</strong> This is the luck in how one's actions and projects turn out. An artist may work diligently for years, but their ultimate success or failure can depend on unpredictable factors like shifting public taste, a chance encounter with a powerful critic, or a sudden change in the art market.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Bernard Williams' famous thought experiment involving the painter Paul Gauguin powerfully illustrates the role of resultant luck. In the experiment, Gauguin makes the morally questionable decision to abandon his family to pursue his art in Tahiti. Williams argues that the ultimate justification of this decision depends entirely on the outcome. If he succeeds and becomes a great painter, his decision is seen in retrospect as a justified, albeit painful, sacrifice for his art. If he fails and produces nothing of value, he is simply a man who selfishly abandoned his family for nothing. The success that confers this retrospective justification was not guaranteed and depended on a great deal of luck—both intrinsic (his talent holding up) and extrinsic (the art world eventually recognizing him). This demonstrates that the very moral and aesthetic value we assign to an artist's life and work is contingent on factors beyond their control. The artist, like the drunk driver who luckily avoids hitting a pedestrian, is at the mercy of fate.</p>

            <h5>2.3 The Social and Economic Determinants of Artistic Success</h5>
            <p>The philosophical argument from moral luck is strongly supported by sociological and economic evidence. Creativity is not a solitary, internal process but is socially constructed, emerging from "dialogues, interactions and practices with others". An artist's work is always situated within, and draws upon, socially constructed languages, techniques, and traditions.</p>
            <p>This social determination of success is formalized in models like that of Sir Alan Bowness, a former director of the Tate, who proposed a deterministic sequence of "conditions of success" for artists. According to Bowness, an artist's fame is "predictable" and follows a rigid progression: first, recognition from peers (often within elite art schools); second, recognition from critics and writers who shape the discourse around art; third, recognition from patrons and collectors who provide financial support; and finally, recognition from the general public. This model reveals that artistic success is not a direct measure of raw talent but is mediated and constructed by a powerful, self-reinforcing institutional system. An artist working in isolation, no matter how brilliant, is unlikely to succeed because they are outside this system of validation.</p>
            <p>The role of institutions—such as universities, museums, galleries, and funding bodies—is therefore paramount in shaping which artists succeed and which fail. These institutions act as gatekeepers, conferring legitimacy and providing the resources and networks necessary for a career in the arts. Furthermore, economic studies show that financial success, both in business and in creative fields, is overwhelmingly a product of luck rather than talent or effort alone. An artist's achievement, therefore, is not an act of pure, uncaused will but the outcome of a complex system of social, institutional, and economic determinants.</p>
            <p>By deconstructing the myth of the Romantic author and applying the lenses of moral luck and sociology, this section reveals that the artist is no more the ultimate author of their success than the criminal is of their failure. Both are products of a dense web of causation. This exposes the core inconsistency in the students' positions: if we absolve the criminal of blame because their actions are determined, we must also absolve the artist of praise, as their achievements are equally determined by forces beyond their control. The concept of "merit," the positive counterpart to "culpability," is shown to be just as philosophically unstable. Both are attributions of desert based on a flawed and inconsistent belief in uncaused agency.</p>
            
            <h3>Part II: A Unified Framework for Agency and Responsibility</h3>
            <p>Having deconstructed the two contradictory poles of libertarian praise for artists and deterministic compassion for criminals, the analysis now turns to constructing a coherent resolution. The contradiction arises from a fundamental philosophical error: the reliance on a model of agency rooted in private, inaccessible "inner states." This part of the report introduces the central thesis of the manuscript <em>Mind, Machine, and Will</em>: a practice-based model of agency, derived from the later philosophy of Ludwig Wittgenstein. This framework relocates meaning, creativity, and responsibility from the hidden theater of the mind to the public arena of social practice. By doing so, it provides a consistent, forward-looking ethic that can account for both praise and blame without resorting to the flawed metaphysics of desert.</p>
            
            <h4>Section 3: The Wittgensteinian Revolution: From Inner States to Public Practice</h4>
            <p>The source of the contradiction lies in a deeply ingrained, yet ultimately incoherent, model of the human mind and its relationship to the world. This model, a legacy of Cartesian philosophy, posits a fundamental split between an inner world of thought, intention, and will, and an outer world of behavior and action. It is this "ghost in the machine" that haunts our legal and ethical discourse, leading us to search for the origins of agency in the mysterious and inaccessible realm of private consciousness.</p>

            <h5>3.1 The Failure of the Inner-State Model</h5>
            <p>The manuscript <em>Mind, Machine, and Will</em> identifies this reliance on inner states as the core "philosophical error" that generates crises in fields as diverse as copyright law, criminal justice, and artificial intelligence. In this view, the value of an artwork is thought to reside in the author's original intention, and the culpability of a criminal act is thought to reside in the defendant's "free choice" to do wrong. The problem with this model is that these inner states are, by definition, private and unobservable. We can never truly know another person's intentions or whether their will was "free." This leads to an impossible demand for a kind of metaphysical transparency—a window into the soul—as the basis for our most important social judgments.</p>
            <p>Ludwig Wittgenstein’s later philosophy provides the crucial tool for dismantling this model. Through his famous "private language argument," Wittgenstein demonstrated that meaning cannot be a private phenomenon. If an individual were to invent a language for their own inner sensations, there would be no way to know if they were using their words correctly from one moment to the next. The distinction between seeming to follow a rule and actually following it would collapse. For meaning to be possible, there must be public, shared criteria for correctness—rules and practices that are established and maintained within a community. This insight has radical consequences: it shifts the foundation of meaning, intention, and agency from the private mind to public practice.</p>

            <h5>3.2 The Practice-Based Alternative</h5>
            <p>The resolution to the failure of the inner-state model is a practice-based alternative. In this Wittgensteinian framework, concepts like understanding, intention, creativity, and responsibility are not names for private mental events but are abilities demonstrated through competent participation in shared, rule-governed activities, which Wittgenstein called "language games". To understand a word is to know how to use it correctly in various social contexts. To be a responsible agent is to be able to follow social and legal rules, give justifications for one's actions, and respond to correction from others in the community.</p>
            <p>This framework replaces the question of metaphysical "choice" with the observable reality of "competence". An artist is considered creative not because of some mysterious inner spark, but because they have mastered the techniques and conventions of their art form and can skillfully manipulate them to produce works that are recognized as valuable by a community of practitioners and audiences. Similarly, a person is held responsible in the legal system not because they possess a "free will," but because they are presumed to have the competence to understand and follow the laws of their society. Agency, in this view, is not a property of a solitary self but a social achievement, a status conferred upon those who can successfully participate in the practices that constitute our shared form of life.</p>
            <p>This shift has a profound implication for the concept of transparency. The inner-state model's demand for metaphysical transparency—a complete audit of an agent's causal history or a direct view into their mind—is both impossible and unnecessary. The practice-based model substitutes this with a more robust and achievable "procedural transparency". In this model, transparency is not about revealing hidden causes but about participating in public, accountable processes. The ultimate transparent act is the social performance of taking responsibility for an outcome within a shared system of rules—the author who declares "I wrote that," or the defendant who is held to account through due process. This preempts the common fear that determinism requires a paralyzing and endless disclosure of causes. Instead, it grounds accountability firmly in the public and procedural act of participation.</p>

            <h4>Section 4: Resolving the Paradox: A Consistent, Forward-Looking Ethic</h4>
            <p>Armed with a practice-based framework, it is now possible to directly address and resolve the students' contradictory intuitions. The resolution requires two steps: first, understanding the psychological source of the asymmetry in their judgments of praise and blame; and second, proposing a consistent, forward-looking ethic that reframes the social function of both.</p>

            <h5>4.1 The Psychological Asymmetry of Praise and Blame</h5>
            <p>The students' tendency to apply a deterministic lens to criminals but a libertarian lens to artists is not a random logical error. It is a reflection of a deep-seated and well-documented psychological asymmetry in how humans process positive and negative moral judgments. Research in moral psychology has consistently shown that blame and praise are not mirror images of each other.</p>
            <p>Blame judgments tend to be more "extreme" and more "differentiated". When we consider a negative action, we are more likely to scrutinize the agent's mental states, intentions, and degree of control with a fine-toothed comb. We differentiate more sharply between a harmful thought, a harmful desire, and a harmful intention, assigning increasing levels of blame as the mental commitment to the act grows. Praise, by contrast, is often applied more broadly and less critically. We are less concerned with the precise mental state behind a positive act; the good outcome is often sufficient for a positive evaluation.</p>
            <p>This asymmetry likely has an evolutionary origin. From the perspective of social regulation and group survival, it is far more urgent to identify, sanction, and deter individuals who pose a threat to the community than it is to precisely calibrate the rewards for those who contribute positively. Our moral psychology is therefore biased toward a more intense and analytical focus on negative deviations from social norms.</p>
            <p>The students' contradiction is a direct manifestation of this cognitive bias. They are, without realizing it, applying our evolved moral psychology. For the criminal (the object of blame), they engage in a highly differentiated and critical analysis, considering the deterministic forces (poverty, trauma, biology) that undermine the agent's control. For the artist (the object of praise), their analysis is less differentiated; they are content to reward the positive outcome without subjecting the artist's "merit" to the same rigorous deterministic scrutiny. Recognizing this psychological root is crucial, as it transforms the pedagogical task from simply pointing out a logical inconsistency to guiding students from an intuitive, psychologically-driven morality to a more reflective, philosophically consistent one.</p>

            <h5>4.2 A Consistent Ethic: Praise and Blame as Social Technologies</h5>
            <p>The resolution to the paradox lies in abandoning the backward-looking framework of desert altogether and adopting a consistent, forward-looking, and instrumental view of both praise and blame. In a deterministic world, the only coherent justification for these social practices is their utility in shaping future behavior to achieve desirable social outcomes. Praise and blame are not metaphysical verdicts on an agent's soul; they are social technologies we use to build a better world.</p>
            <p>This instrumental logic must be applied consistently across both domains:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Criminals and Blame:</strong> We should not blame criminals in a retributive sense, because they do not "deserve" it. However, we should absolutely intervene in their behavior. The justification for this intervention (whether through rehabilitation, education, or incapacitation) is not to exact revenge for a past wrong, but to protect the community, prevent future harm, and encourage pro-social behavior. The focus is entirely forward-looking.</li>
                <li><strong>Artists and Praise:</strong> We should not praise artists because they metaphysically "deserve" it for their unique, self-caused genius. We should praise and reward artists because doing so incentivizes the creation of art, which our society deems valuable. The system of rewards, grants, and recognition is a social technology designed to encourage a certain kind of productive behavior that enriches our collective life. The focus, again, is entirely forward-looking.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The contradiction dissolves when we stop asking the metaphysical question, "What does this person truly deserve?" and start asking the pragmatic, social question, "What kind of behavior do we as a community want to encourage or discourage?" The purpose of our social practices of accountability and recognition is not to achieve metaphysical accuracy about an agent's inner state, but to foster a safer, more productive, and more flourishing society. This provides a consistent, pragmatic, and philosophically robust answer to the initial challenge, one that retains a place for both compassion in our justice system and celebration in our cultural life, but grounds both in a coherent, unified framework.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion: The Social Function of Agency in a Determined World</h3>
            <p>This report has embarked on a philosophical journey designed to resolve a deep and common contradiction in our moral intuitions: the asymmetric application of determinism to criminals and artists. The analysis began by systematically deconstructing both poles of this contradiction. The deterministic view of the criminal, grounded in the neuroscientific work of Robert Sapolsky, was shown to lead inexorably to a justice system without desert, focused on rehabilitation and public safety rather than retributive blame. Subsequently, the libertarian view of the artist was dismantled using tools from literary theory, the philosophy of moral luck, and the sociology of creativity. This revealed that artistic "merit" is no less a product of a deterministic web of genetic, circumstantial, and social luck than is criminal behavior, rendering the basis for praise as philosophically unstable as the basis for blame.</p>
            <p>The resolution to this paradox was found by shifting the entire philosophical framework away from a flawed "inner-state" model of agency. Drawing on the Wittgensteinian revolution in philosophy, the report argued for a practice-based model in which agency, responsibility, and creativity are not private mental properties but public, social achievements. In this view, to be an agent is to demonstrate competence within the shared, rule-governed practices of a community.</p>
            <p>This new framework allows for a consistent, forward-looking ethic. The contradiction is resolved by recognizing that both praise and blame are not backward-looking judgments of metaphysical desert, but forward-looking social technologies. We intervene in the lives of criminals not because they deserve to be punished, but because we want to build a safer society. We praise and reward artists not because they deserve accolades for their uncaused genius, but because we want to incentivize the creation of art that enriches our collective cultural life. The goal of these social practices is not to be metaphysically accurate, but to be socially useful.</p>
            <p>In a world without libertarian free will, agency is not lost. It is relocated. It moves from the private, inaccessible theater of the individual mind to the public, observable arena of social practice. Responsibility and merit cease to be mystical properties of the soul and become instead the pragmatic tools a community uses to negotiate, regulate, and shape its collective future. The final message is one of intellectual and ethical gain. Moving to a consistent, practice-based framework does not diminish the value of art or the importance of justice. Rather, it provides a more coherent, compassionate, and pragmatic foundation for both, opening the door to a more just and flourishing way of living together in a determined world.</p>
