When a user starts a conversation with the phrase "I have a new text file for you in the “original-text-of-posts” folder.", it signals a request to follow a specific, multi-step workflow for creating and integrating a new blog post. The user will provide the filename of a new `.txt` file located in the `original-text-of-posts` directory, the source URL, and author information in a specific format.

Your primary goal is to automate the conversion of this text file into a new, properly formatted HTML blog post and then link it from the main `index.html` page.

Here is the step-by-step process you must follow:

1.  **Acknowledge and Identify:**
    *   Acknowledge the user's request and confirm the name of the `.txt` file you will be processing.
    *   Identify the next available post number. Look at the existing `post*.html` files and determine the next number in the sequence (e.g., if `post9.html` is the last one, the new one will be `post10.html`).

2.  **Read Necessary Files:**
    *   Read the content of the new `.txt` file from the `/Users/familyplate/ai-evil/blog/original-text-of-posts/` directory.
    *   Read the content of a recent, existing blog post file (e.g., `post9.html`) to understand the current HTML structure, boilerplate, and formatting conventions. This will serve as your template.
    *   Read the content of `index.html` to understand how the list of posts is structured, so you can add the new one correctly.

3.  **Generate the New HTML Post:**
    *   Create a new HTML file named `post[N].html` (where `N` is the next number you identified).
    *   Use the structure from the template post you read. This includes:
        *   The `<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags.
        *   The `<meta>` tags for charset and viewport.
        *   The `<link>` tag for `style.css`.
        *   The main header: `<h1>Mind, Machine, and Will: Imagined Responses</h1>` with a link to `index.html`.
    *   **Format the Content:**
        *   The first line of the `.txt` file is the title of the post. Enclose it in an `<h2>` tag.
        *   The second line is the author and date. Enclose it in `<p class="meta">`.
        *   The third paragraph contains the source information. Italicize it (`<em>`) and include a hyperlink (`<a>`) to the source URL provided by the user.
        *   The rest of the content from the `.txt` file should be placed directly into the post, with each paragraph enclosed in `<p>` tags.
        *   Add the standard footer with a link back to the index page.

4.  **Update the Homepage:**
    *   Modify the `index.html` file.
    *   Find the `<ul>` (unordered list) that contains the links to the blog posts.
    *   Add a new `<li>` (list item) at the top of the list for the new post.
    *   The list item should contain a link to the new file (e.g., `<a href="post10.html">Post Title</a>`), using the title from the `<h2>` tag you created.

5.  **Confirmation:**
    *   Once you have successfully created the new post file and updated the `index.html` file, inform the user that the process is complete. For example: "I have created `post10.html` and linked it from the homepage."
