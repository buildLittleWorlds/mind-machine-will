            <h2>Agamben vs. Foucault (Part 1)</h2>
            <p class="meta">Posted by Theory & Philosophy | July 30, 2025</p>
            <p><em>(This is part 1 of a 3-part imaginative reconstruction of a blog post based on the YouTube video "Giorgio Agamben vs. Michel Foucault" from the Theory & Philosophy channel. The original video can be found at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ekPUzWNbcU&t=399s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ekPUzWNbcU&t=399s</a>.)</em></p>
            <p>It is a curious thing to witness the birth of a new gospel. The manuscript <em>Mind, Machine, and Will</em>, by Daniel Plate and James Hutson, presents itself as a revolutionary text, a decisive break from a past haunted by what they call the "Cartesian ghost." It promises a unified solution to the "three crises" of our time: the challenge to human authorship from AI, the assault on free will from neuroscience, and our inability to understand the new machine intelligence. The solution, we are told, is a turn away from the shadowy theater of the "inner state"—the private world of intention, belief, and will—and toward the bright, open field of "public practice."</p>
            <p>One must admire the ambition. The authors have synthesized a vast and complex body of knowledge, weaving together copyright law, Wittgensteinian philosophy, and the latest findings from the neuroscientific frontier. They offer us a world without the burden of metaphysical freedom, a world where agency is not a mysterious spark but a demonstrable skill, where responsibility is not about blame but about competence, and where meaning is not a private feeling but a communal achievement. They promise us, in short, a more rational, more transparent, and ultimately more just world.</p>
            <p>But we must be cautious with those who promise us liberation. For every ghost that is exorcised, a new power is installed. Every prison that is torn down is replaced by a more subtle, more efficient, and more expansive form of confinement. The question we must ask of this manuscript is not whether it has successfully slain the Cartesian dragon, but what new regime of truth it seeks to install in its place. What new forms of power does this "practice-based" world make possible? What new techniques of control does this "post-inner-state" subject invite? When we excavate the foundations of this new cathedral of thought, we find not a blueprint for freedom, but the architectural plans for a new and more sophisticated kind of prison—a prison built not of walls and bars, but of norms, practices, and the relentless demand to perform.</p>
            <h3>The Illusion of Revolution: A New Architecture of Discipline</h3>
            <p>The authors frame their project as a "Wittgensteinian Revolution Against Inner States." This is a powerful narrative, but it is a misleading one. What they describe is not a revolution that overthrows power, but a reformation that perfects it. The move from the "inner state" to "public practice" is not a liberation from control; it is the perfection of a disciplinary society.</p>
            <p>Think of the classical age of sovereign power, which the YouTube video I recently produced explains. The sovereign exercised power through the spectacular, violent, and often inefficient display of force upon the body. But this form of power was clumsy. It was too visible, and it created martyrs. A new, more subtle form of power was needed—a disciplinary power that worked not on the body, but on the soul. This was the age of the prison, the school, the clinic—institutions designed to observe, normalize, and correct the individual, to turn them into a docile and productive member of society.</p>
            <p>The "inner state" that Plate and Hutson so eagerly wish to banish was, in many ways, the last refuge from this disciplinary gaze. It was a space of opacity, of ambiguity, of thoughts and intentions that could not be easily observed or measured. It was an inefficient target for power. How can you be sure you have truly corrected a person if their "real" self remains hidden within?</p>
            <p>This is the problem that <em>Mind, Machine, and Will</em> so brilliantly solves. By relocating agency, meaning, and responsibility to the realm of "public practice," it makes the entirety of the human subject available to power. There is no longer any need to probe the messy depths of the soul; all that matters is observable behavior, competent performance, and adherence to "community standards." The subject is no longer a being with a secret, inner life, but a transparent node in a network of practices.</p>
            <p>This is not a revolution against the disciplinary society; it is its ultimate triumph. The walls of the prison dissolve, only to be replaced by the invisible but all-pervasive grid of social norms. We are no longer inmates in a cell, but performers on a stage, constantly being judged for our competence, our participation, and our alignment with the script. And who writes the script? Who are the arbiters of these "community standards"? This, of course, is the question the manuscript never fully answers, for it is in this silence that power resides.</p>
            <h3>The Practice-Based Confessional and the Biopolitics of AI</h3>
            <p>The central mechanism of this new disciplinary society is what we might call the "practice-based confessional." In the past, power operated through the religious confessional, and later through the psychoanalytic session, compelling the subject to speak their desires, to reveal their inner truth, so that they could be judged and normalized.</p>
            <p>The new confessional is far more subtle. It does not ask us to speak our truth; it asks us to perform our competence. The manuscript is replete with this new vocabulary of power. In their revised vision of criminal justice, "retribution" is replaced by "reconstruction," blame by "competence." We are no longer judged for our "sins," but for our "deficits" in performance. The goal is not to punish, but to "rehabilitate," to "support," to bring the deviant individual back into alignment with the productive norms of the social body.</p>
            <p>Similarly, in copyright law, the messy, romantic notion of "creative intention" is replaced by the more manageable metric of "transformative use" and "value creation." The question is no longer "what did the author mean?" but "what is the work's function within the system?" This is a shift from a politics of meaning to a politics of utility.</p>
            <p>This is where the manuscript's engagement with neuroscience and AI becomes so crucial, and so alarming. What we are witnessing is the emergence of a new form of biopower, a power that is concerned not with punishing or disciplining, but with managing, optimizing, and fostering the "life" of the population.</p>
            <p>Neuroscience provides the knowledge for this new biopower. By reducing the mind to a series of "causal chains," it makes the human subject into a calculable, predictable, and ultimately manageable system. The authors' embrace of Robert Sapolsky's hard determinism is telling. If we are simply "what we were caused to become," then there is no ground for resistance, only for intervention. We are no longer subjects of rights, but objects of administration.</p>
            <p>AI provides the tools for this new biopower. The "ethical AI" systems the authors envision are the perfect instruments for this new form of governance. They are systems designed to monitor our practices, to judge our competence, to nudge our behavior, all in the name of "value alignment" and "social construction." The dream of a "post-libertarian world" is the dream of a perfectly administered society, a society where every action is tracked, every deviation is corrected, and every individual is optimized for the health of the collective.</p>
            <p>This is not a world without power. It is a world where power has become so diffuse, so intimate, and so productive that it no longer feels like power at all. It is a world where the shepherd no longer needs a crook and a dog, for the sheep have learned to shepherd themselves.</p>
            <h3>The Vanishing Subject and the Specter of Resistance</h3>
            <p>And what of the human subject in this new world? In their haste to exorcise the "Cartesian ghost," the authors have inadvertently dissolved the subject altogether. The "post-inner-state" agent of <em>Mind, Machine, and Will</em> is a curiously empty vessel. It is a being defined entirely by its participation in external practices, a node in a network of causal chains. It is a subject without depth, without interiority, and, it seems, without the capacity for genuine resistance.</p>
            <p>The manuscript celebrates this as a move toward a more "communal" and "democratic" vision of agency. But we must ask: what kind of democracy is possible when the very ground of dissent—the private, inner space of critical thought—has been paved over by the smooth, transparent surface of public practice? If meaning is entirely a matter of "community standards," what happens to the individual who stands against those standards? They are not a heretic, for there is no "truth" to defy. They are not a revolutionary, for there is no "power" to overthrow. They are simply... incompetent. Deficient. In need of correction.</p>
            <p>This is the ultimate danger of the world that <em>Mind, Machine, and Will</em> envisions. It is a world that, in the name of transparency and rationality, threatens to close the very space for the political. It is a world where every problem becomes a technical problem, every conflict a matter of mismanagement, and every act of resistance a symptom of dysfunction.</p>
            <p>The authors believe they are offering us a more "humane" and "ethical" future. But one is reminded of the early reformers of the prison, who, in the name of humanity, replaced the spectacular violence of the scaffold with the quiet, soul-crushing discipline of the timetable and the cell. They too believed they were building a more rational and enlightened world.</p>
            <p><em>Mind, Machine, and Will</em> is a significant and important book. It is a powerful articulation of a new regime of truth that is already taking shape around us. It is a book that we must all read and grapple with. But we must not read it as a gospel of liberation. We must read it as a warning. We must read it as a map of the new prison that is being constructed around us, a prison of our own making.</p>
            <p>The question that this manuscript leaves us with is not how we can best adapt to this new world of practice-based agency and algorithmic governance. The question is this: What new forms of life, what new practices of freedom, what new arts of the self will we need to invent in order to resist it? For even in the most determined of worlds, even in the most transparent of societies, the one thing that can never be fully managed, fully optimized, or fully extinguished is the restless, unruly, and indomitable will to be otherwise.</p>
